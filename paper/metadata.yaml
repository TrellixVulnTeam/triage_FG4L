abstract: |
    Developer identification is a prerequisite for assigning developers to tasks
    (e.g., bug reports, feature requests, or code reviews). Many state-of-the
    art developer identification techniques (DITs) recommend expert developers
    by relying on feature location techniques (FLTs) to locate software entities
    related to a task and mine ownership information about those related
    entities.  In this paper, we explore a topic-modeling-based DIT in which the
    model is built incrementally from source code history and recommends
    a ranked list of developers based on their activity (i.e., words they
    change). Using an activity-based approach, we can recommend developers
    directly from the topic model without needing to mine additional information
    like a location-based approach.
