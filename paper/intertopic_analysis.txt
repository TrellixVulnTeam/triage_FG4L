things I noticed looking at the Intertopic Distance Map: 

+ the amount of overlapping between the top topics is distinguishably different looking at the changeset, snapshot and mystery map topic distributions 

    changeset: the top topics in the changeset distribution shows a few examples of slight to a considerable amount of overlapping between the top topics. that is, there seems to be greater connection between the top topics. 
    
    snapshot: the top topics in the snapshot distribution shows minimal to no overlapping of top topics with a greater amount of space/less similarities/clustering between the top topics. that is, there seems to be less of a connection between the top topics. 

    mystery map: the top topics in the mystery map has a similar amount of overlapping between topics to the changeset distribution. In general though, they are less spread out, and more closely clustered compared to both the snapshot and changeset distributions.
