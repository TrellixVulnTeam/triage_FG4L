Canopy and KMeans clustering implementations use Float[] representations instead of the new Vector package. They need to be migrated and the Vector package may need some enhancement to support the notion of payloads. This would be a good project for somebody new to the project who wants to get involved. If somebody wants to implement this, just assign the issue to yourself and I will hold off doing it myself.
