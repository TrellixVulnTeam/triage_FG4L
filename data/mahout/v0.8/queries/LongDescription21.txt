I am about to write a sequential version of EP that could be used as a reference implementation.

Parallelization should be relatively straightforward since every member of the population is independently mutated and evaluated.  

The implementation will include the recorded step strategy for dense vector states, but will be easily extended to other state types and other strategies.
