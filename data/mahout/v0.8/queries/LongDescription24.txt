This is a very skeletal but functional implementation for LWLR. It outputs n lines where n is the number of dimensions. ith line = sum(x[i]*x[ind]) where ind is the index of independant variable. So the actual gradient = 2nd line/1st line for the classical 2D.
Contains a single small test case for demonstration.
