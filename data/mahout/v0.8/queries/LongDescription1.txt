http://lucene.apache.org/mahout/mailinglists.html doesn't link to the mailing lists that are available via the cwiki â€“ this is confusing to new users, potentially interested developers. Included is a patch to  src/documentation/content/xdocs/mailinglists.xml to include links to those mailingl ists.
