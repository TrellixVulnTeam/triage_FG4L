IndexException and CardinalityException should be unchecked exceptions by analogy to ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Having them be checked causes lots of try/catches in code that doesn't have a chance of fixing the problem.  It should be understood that these can happen in any matrix manipulation code just like IllegalArgumentException, ArithmeticException or ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException can happen in any numerical codes.
