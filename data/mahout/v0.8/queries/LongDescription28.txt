One quarter of the work that could be done for Mahout-4. EM seems a bit to general a concept to be implemented only for the use case of PLSI, so the task of this issue is to find a way to implement EM general enough to be reused. As EM conceptually is related to k-Means it might be possible to make the implementation general enough to include k-Means as a special case.
