At the end of a kmeans job at EMR, I like to look through the clusters.  Unfortunately ClusterDumper writes to System.out or a local file.  I added a small conditional to examine the filename to see if it starts with s3n://, and if so to open up a FileSystem to write to s3 instead of to the local filesystem so that the output file is available after the cluster is shut down.  I am creating the patch now (tests are still running from the change in MAHOUT-700), so I will add the patch to this issue shortly.
