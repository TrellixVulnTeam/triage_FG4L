As threatened on the mailing list, an effort to remove the User and Item abstractions in the CF code is underway. This issue encapsulates phase 1, in which the GenericUser, GenericItem and BooleanPrefUser classes are de-generified, and then, all "ID" objects are converted from Object to Comparable<?>. Patch coming.
