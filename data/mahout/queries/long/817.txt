It seems that a simple solution should exist to integrate PCA mean subtraction into SSVD algorithm without making it a pre-requisite step and also avoiding densifying the big input. 

Several approaches were suggested:

1) subtract mean off B
2) propagate mean vector deeper into algorithm algebraically where the data is already collapsed to smaller matrices
3) --?

It needs some math done first . I'll take a stab at 1 and 2 but thoughts and math are welcome.
