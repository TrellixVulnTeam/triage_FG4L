In another project I have a useful little class, SequenceFileIterable, which simplifies iterating over a sequence file. It's like FileLineIterable. I'd like to add it, then use it throughout the code. See patch, which for now merely has the proposed new classes. 

Well it also moves some other iterator-related classes that seemed to be outside their rightful home in common.iterator.
