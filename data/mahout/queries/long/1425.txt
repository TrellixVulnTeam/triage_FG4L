As discussed on the mailing list a few weeks back I started working on an SGD classifier example with the bank marketing dataset from UCI: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

See https://github.com/frankscholten/mahout-sgd-bank-marketing

Ted has also made further changes that were very useful so I suggest to add this example to Mahout

Ted: can you tell a bit more about the log transforms? Some of them are just Math.log while others are more complex expressions. 

What else is needed to contribute it to Mahout? Anything that could improve the example?
