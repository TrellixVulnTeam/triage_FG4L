Clean up the code in org.apache.mahout.math.list, including some testing and cleanup of some things that it calls.

This includes:

1) More features in the Velocity code generator, including code to avoid generating a shadow of a checked-in file, and code to allow explicit suppression of individual outputs. Also an extra macro or two to make the template neater in some cases.

2) The stack of code from AbstractList to AbstractXxxList to XxxArrayList generated with templates. AbstractCollection eliminated. ObjectArrayList preserved for now until the maps can be weaned from it.

3) Removed 2 broken functions from the Sorting class.
