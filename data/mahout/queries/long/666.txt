The directories created during the times() and timesSquared() methods in DistributedSparseMatrix leave behind a lot of cruft. While the individual files are tagged with deleteOnExit, but the directories are not. Also, but not deleting them until JVM exit, a job that does repeated matrix/vector multiplies, like DistributedLanczosSolver, creates a lot of temp files that stick around for the whole run, even though the results they contain are read once and then never again. 

Our cluster admins enforce both file count and size quotas, so since 5 temp files/directories are created on each iteration of DistributedLanczosSolver, we're constantly bumping into the quota with large SVDs.
