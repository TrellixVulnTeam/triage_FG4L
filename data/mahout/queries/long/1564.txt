MapReduce and DSL Naive Bayes implementations currently lack the ability to classify a new document (outside of the training/holdout corpus).  This New feature will do the following.

1. Vectorize a new text document using the dictionary and document frequencies from the training/holdout corpus 

	assume the original corpus was vectorized using `seq2sparse`; step (1) will use all of the same parameters.



2. Score and label a new document using a previously trained model.

This effort will need to be done in parallel for MRLegacy and DSL implementations.  Neither should be too much work.
