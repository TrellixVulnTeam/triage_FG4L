Clustering algorithms presently take the document vectors as input.  Generating these document vectors from the text can be broken in two tasks. 

1. Create lucene index of the input  plain-text documents 
2. From the index, generate the document vectors (sparse) with weights as TF-IDF values of the term. With lucene index, this value can be calculated very easily. 

Presently, I have created two separate utilities, which could possibly be invoked from another class.
