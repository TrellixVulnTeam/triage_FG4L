Running "seqdirectory" (Sequence Files from Input Directory) from the command line and specifying a custom filter using the -filter parameter, the argument is ignored and the default "PrefixAdditionFilter" is used on the input. No exception is thrown.

When the same command is run with "-xm sequential", the filter is found and works as expected.
