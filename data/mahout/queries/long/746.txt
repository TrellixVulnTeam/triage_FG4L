I refactored the code in org.apache.mahout.classifier.naivebayes to extend AbstractJob, decoupled the model serialization from the job output, extracted trainer classes and tried to clarify naming and reduce code complexity. I also added tests for the training M/R code as well as a toy integration test.

It would be great if someone could review my patch to make sure I didn't break anything.
