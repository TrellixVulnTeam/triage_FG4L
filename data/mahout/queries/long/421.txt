I'm trying to use UncenteredCosineSimilarity. When calculating similarity between users in AbstractSimilarity>>itemSimilarity, there's a condition to determine whether to center the data:

double result;
if (centerData) 
{
  ... get result with centering
}
 else 
{
   ... get result without
}

In AbstractSimilarity>>itemSimilarity, there's no conditional. It always centers the data. Shouldn't it only center the data when centerData is true?
