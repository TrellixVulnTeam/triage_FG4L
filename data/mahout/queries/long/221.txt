FP Bonsai is a method to prune long chained FP-Trees for faster growth.

This implementation also adds a transaction preprocessing map/reduce job which converts a list of transactions 
{1, 2, 4, 5}
, 
{1, 2, 3}
, 
{1, 2}
 into a tree structure and thus saves space during fpgrowth map/reduce 
the tree formed from above is. For typical this improves the storage space by a great amount and thus saves on time during shuffle and sort
(1,3) -> (2,3) | - (4,1) - (5,1)
                      (3,1)        

Also added a reducer to PFPgrowth (not part of the original paper) which does this compression and saves on space. 

This patch also adds an example transaction dataset generator from flickr and delicious data set https://www.uni-koblenz.de/FB4/Institutes/IFI/AGStaab/Research/DataSets/PINTSExperimentsDataSets/
Both of them are GIG of tag data. Where "date userid itemid tag" is given. The example maker creates a transaction based on all the unique tags a user has tagged on an item.
