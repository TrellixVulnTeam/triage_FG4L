The AbstractMatrix.java class uses clone() instead of like() in the methods which create a new matrix and populate it with calculated data. This means that the contents of 'this' is copied into the return matrix, then promptly overwritten.

This patch fixes this problem by substituting like() and changing the code to not rely on having the values of 'this' in the clone.

Also, this allows generated matrices like a random matrix to reuse the code from AbstractMatrix; read-only matrices cannot populate their clones.
