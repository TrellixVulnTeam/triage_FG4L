Nobody overrides this implementation:
[code]
  @Override
  public Matrix cross(Vector other) {
    Matrix result = matrixLike(size, other.size());
    for (int row = 0; row < size; row++) 
{
      result.assignRow(row, other.times(getQuick(row)));
    }
    return result;
  }
[code]

I think you can imagine what kind of performance this has on sparse vectors (k non-zeroes) with high cardinality (N) - scales as O(N^2) instead of O(k^2).

I think the right approach is to not implement this in AbstractVector at all, and force concrete implementations to properly implement it performantly.

Alternatively, killing this method entirely might be appropriate.  If anyone was using it (and uses sparse vectors), they'd have complained about this by now.
