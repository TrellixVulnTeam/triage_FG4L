As discussed on the mailing list, seems desirable to remove the direct dependence on HBase for now. The integration only exists for the Naive Bayes Classifier, and is based on an old version. A more comprehensive strategy for integrating with data sources, such as via Gora, is viewed as a desirable goal for later. This is a step in that direction.
