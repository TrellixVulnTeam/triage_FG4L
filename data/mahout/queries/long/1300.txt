Support for easy matrix views based on (Int,Int)=>Double function. 

Current derived views: 
(1) general functional view
(2) transposed matrix view
(3) uniform matrix view (based on function composition over symmetric uniform)
(4) symmetric uniform matrix view (based on murmur64)
(5) random gaussian matrix view.

I know that there's a trinary random matrix as well which could be scripted out as a view as well (methinks), as well as Omega thing in distributed SSVD which also perhaps could be replaced by a symmetric uniform view.
