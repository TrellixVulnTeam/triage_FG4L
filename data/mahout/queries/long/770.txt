In the spirit of MongoDBDataModel I'd like to add a CassandraDataModel as a backing store for non-distributed recommenders. 
It takes a somewhat different approach, heavily reliant on in-memory caching, as Cassandra is a different beast.
Patch is attached. This goes in integration, not core. It uses Hector, not the raw Thrift API.
