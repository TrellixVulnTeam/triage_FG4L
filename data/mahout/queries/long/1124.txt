Deprecating some recommenders for the following reasons:

org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.impl.recommender.svd.FunkSVDFactorizer

RatingSGDFactorizer should be learning faster and has a nicer model as
it includes user/item biases


org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.impl.recommender.svd.ImplicitLinearRegressionFactorizer

Seems to be using the same model as ALSWRFactorizer, however there are
no tests and ALSWR can handle more explicit and implicit feedback


org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.impl.recommender.TreeClusteringRecommender
org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.impl.recommender.TreeClusteringRecommender2
org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.impl.recommender.knn

I don't recall anybody using those or asking about them the last years.
