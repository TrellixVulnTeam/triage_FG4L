FPGrowth reports the support of itemsets individually - in that - if Item X appears "individually" 12 times and appears with item Y 10 times (a total of 22 times) AND item Y appears "individually" 4 times (a total of 14 times) then this is what the output will be (say for min-support 2)

12 X
10 XY
4  Y

Instead of 
22 X
10 XY
14 Y

Also, because of this If the minimum support is 5 then the output will look like : 
12 X
10 X Y
Thus totally Ignoring Y

if the minimum support is 11 then the output will look like 
12 X
again Ignoring Y

if the minimum support is 13 then there will be NO output. even though all the way along Xs support was 22 and Y's was 14



Even if we want to show just the maximal itemsets (although i would like to see ALL the frequent itemsets - maximal or not) this output is wrong as with a support of 13 we should still have seen X(22) and Y(14)


Now Say you add XYZ 11 times


for support 1 you'd see
12 X
10 X Y
11 X Y Z
4   Y




And for support 11 you'd see
12 X
11 X Y Z

Although I'd expect the output (for both s=1 & s=11) to be 
33 X
25 Y 
21 XY
11 Z
11 XZ
11 YZ
11 XYZ
