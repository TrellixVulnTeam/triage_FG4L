If the matrix which is being multiplied by has been transformed into a column-sparse matrix backed by a SequenceFile<IntWritable,VectorWritable>, then doing a simple map-side join on the two, and taking the (sparse) outer product of each row-pair, and then doing a matrix-summing reducer (probably row-at-a-time, for memory constraints) would implement sparse matrix multiplication in one pass over the data.
