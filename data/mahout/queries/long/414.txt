If specifying the number of mappers and reducers is a common activity which users need to perform in running Mahout applications on Hadoop clusters then we need to have a standard way of specifying them in our APIs without exposing the full set of Hadoop options, especially for our non-power-users. This is the case for some applications already but others require the use of Hadoop-level -D arguments to achieve reasonable out-of-the-box parallelism even when running our examples. The usability defect is that some of our algorithms won't scale without it and that we don't have a standard way to express this in our APIs.
