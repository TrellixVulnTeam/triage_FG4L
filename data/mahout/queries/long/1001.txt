While running the recommendations with ASFEMail dataset using the example script provided with mahout, we noticed that execution time for unsymmetrify mapper is very long.  While profiling the task we noticed a hotspot consuming high CPU cycles.  Please find the attached patch addressing issue and optimizes the unsymmetrify mapper class.  This patch while retaining functionality(verified the output with and without patch) speeds up the unsymmetrify mapper by more then 5X on x86 architectures.
