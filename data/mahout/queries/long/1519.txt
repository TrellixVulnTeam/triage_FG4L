Andrew Palumbo if I understand your work in MAHOUT-1504 correctly, the theta training is only necessary for complementary naive bayes, right?
Then, we should remove the StandardthetaTrainer and make the TrainNaiveBayesJob only do the theta training in the complementary case.

Correct me if I miss something here.
