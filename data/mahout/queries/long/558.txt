GenericItembased Recommender currently excludes all items that are not similar at least one of the input items when computing the most similar items to a collection of items. We should introduce a way to have the user decide whether he/she wants this behavior or he/she wants to have all items included that are similar to at least one of the input items, which is more useful in practice in my experience.
