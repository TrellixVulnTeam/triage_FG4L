This is a class implementing a cosine distance measure. In various places I've seen cosine similarity defined as being the cosine of the angle between vectors - cos(a,b) - and cosine distance being (1 - cos(a,b)), so in keeping with the other distance measures, this returns 1-cos(angle) as the distance.

Made a new test class rather than using the default distance measure check as the vectors in the current default test class all have a cosine distance of zero between them ([1,1,1,1,1,1], [3,3,3,3,3,3] and [6,6,6,6,6,6]). The test checks the cosine distances between [1,0,0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,0,0,0] and [1,1,1,1,1,1].
