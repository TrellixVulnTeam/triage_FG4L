Between Hadoop 1 and 2, the string value of the Configuration option that stores the mapper classname in MultithreadedMapper changed from "mapred.map.multithreadedrunner.class" to "mapreduce.mapper.multithreadedmapper.mapclass".

Since there is a stable API (getMapperClass()) that abstracts these differences away, we should use that instead.
