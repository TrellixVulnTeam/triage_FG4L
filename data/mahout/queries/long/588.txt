For Taming Text, I've commissioned some benchmarking work on Mahout's clustering algorithms.  I've asked the two doing the project to do all the work in the open here.  The goal is to use a publicly reusable dataset (for now, the ASF mail archives, assuming it is big enough) and run on EC2 and make all resources available so others can reproduce/improve.

I'd like to add the setup code to utils (although it could possibly be done as a Vectorizer) and the publication of the results will be put up on the Wiki as well as in the book.  This issue is to track the patches, etc.
