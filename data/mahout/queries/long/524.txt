I've committed a new display example that attempts to push the standard mixture of models data set through spectral k-means. After some tweaking of configuration arguments and a bug fix in EigenCleanupJob it runs spectral k-means to completion. The display example is expecting 2-d clustered points and the example is producing 5-d points. Additional I/O work is needed before this will play with the rest of the clustering algorithms.
