Dictionary file format generated from lucene.vectors is not in SequenceFileFormat and hence not acceptable as input to CVB clustering.

The problem code from Driver.java




    File dictOutFile = new File(dictOut);
    log.info("Dictionary Output file: {}", dictOutFile);
    Writer writer = Files.newWriter(dictOutFile, Charsets.UTF_8);
    DelimitedTermInfoWriter tiWriter = new DelimitedTermInfoWriter(writer, delimiter, field);
    try {
      tiWriter.write(termInfo);
    } finally {
      Closeables.close(tiWriter, false);
    }
