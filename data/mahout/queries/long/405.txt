A few cases like IntIntFunction are interfaces and don't need further tests to undeprecate.  Others like MersenneTwister are a little tricker.

Here is a list of commonly used interfaces that can be undeprecated:

[deprecation] org.apache.mahout.math.function.Double9Function in org.apache.mahout.math.function has been deprecated
[deprecation] org.apache.mahout.math.function.IntIntDoubleFunction in org.apache.mahout.math.function has been deprecated
[deprecation] org.apache.mahout.math.function.IntIntFunction in org.apache.mahout.math.function has been deprecated
