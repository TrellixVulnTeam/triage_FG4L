The Mahout patch of the algorithm is not handling all types of sparse input efficiently. BtJob doesn't handle SequentialSparseVector in a way to pick only non-zero elements from initial input and QJob doesn't iterate over RandomAccessSparseVector correctly. With extremely sparse inputs (0.05% non-zero elements) that leads to a terrible inefficiency in the aforementioned jobs (QJob, BtJob).
