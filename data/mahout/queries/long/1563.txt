We need to clean up warnings in the maven logs.  They seem to have piled up recently; some are about scala lib version conflicts, some are about deprecated APIs, some are about code style.

Some may be fine for now but extra warnings in build logs feels like bad hygiene to me.

Some examples:

[WARNING]  Expected all dependencies to require Scala version: 2.10.3
