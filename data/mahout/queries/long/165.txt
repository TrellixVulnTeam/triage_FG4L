In SparseVector, we need primitives hash map for index and values. The present implementation of this hash map is not as efficient as some of the other implementations in non-Apache projects. 

In an experiment, I found that, for get/set operations, the primitive hash of  Colt performance an order of magnitude better than OrderedIntDoubleMapping. For iteration it is 2x slower, though. 

Using Colt in Sparsevector improved performance of canopy generation. For an experimental dataset, the current implementation takes 50 minutes. Using Colt, reduces this duration to 19-20 minutes. That's 60% reduction in the delay.
