SequenceFilesFromMailArchivesTest.testSequential is failing only on ubuntu3 and ubuntu6 Jenkins nodes. Because of that, MahoutQuality and integration job builds either fail or are successful depending on where they get run.

Test fails because it expects entries in chunk-0 SequenceFile to be in specific order, but that order is not guaranteed because of the way the chunk-0 is created/filled - SequenceFilesFromMailArchives traverses input using Java's

File[] java.io.File.listFiles(FileFilter filter)

which does not guarantee order of files/directories.

Unless we want in SequenceFileIterator to guarantee order by sorting, test needs to be changed to verify presence of given files and their content, but not their exact order.
