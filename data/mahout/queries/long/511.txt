I just tried running the SGD example with the following command line (adapted
from the corresponding JIRA issue):

./bin/mahout org.apache.mahout.classifier.sgd.TrainLogistic --passes 100 --rate
50 --lambda 0.001 --input examples/src/main/resources/donut.csv --features 21 â€“
output donut.model --target color --categories 2 --predictors x y xx xy yy a b c
--types n n

When running the code above I ran into a few NullPointerExceptions - I was able
to fix them with a few tiny changes. If not stripped they should be attached to
this mail to highlight the lines of code that caused the trouble. However I was
wondering whether I simply used the wrong command line.
