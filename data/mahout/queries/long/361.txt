Our poms declare a dependency on the slf4j core, but not on any of the implementation modules. Thus, if an unsuspecting user adds a dependency on our stuff, and runs, they get a exception from slf4j complaining that there's no implementation. I claim that it would be more better to declare a dependency on the JDK14 module, and those users who really care about using something else can exclude it and include their own.
