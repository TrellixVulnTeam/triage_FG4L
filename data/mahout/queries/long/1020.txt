Conversation with between Pat Ferrel and Jeff Eastman on the user list

Hi Pat,

I don't have a good answer here. Evidently, something in CDbw has become broken and you are the first to notice. When I run TestCDbwEvaluator, the values for k-means and fuzzy-k are clearly incorrect. The values for Canopy, MeanShift and Dirichlet are not so obviously incorrect but I remain suspicious. Something must have become broken in the recent clustering refactoring.

From the method CDbwEvaluator.invalidCluster comment (used to enable pruning):

	Return if the cluster is valid. Valid clusters must have more than 2 representative points,
	and at least one of them must be different than the cluster center. This is because the
	representative points extraction will duplicate the cluster center if it is empty.



Oddly enough, inspection of the test log indicates that only k-means and fuzzy-k are not pruning clusters. Clearly some more investigation is needed. I will take a look at it tomorrow. In the mean time if you develop any additional insight please do share it with us.

Thanks,
Jeff
