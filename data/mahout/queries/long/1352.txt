Can we add an option to output a SequenceFile? I hard coded it to allow the Solr-recommender to work with the output file but it is probably best put in an option.


      //extract out the recommendations
     Job aggregateAndRecommend = prepareJob(
             new Path(aggregateAndRecommendInput), outputPath, SequenceFileInputFormat.class,
             PartialMultiplyMapper.class, VarLongWritable.class, PrefAndSimilarityColumnWritable.class,
             AggregateAndRecommendReducer.class, VarLongWritable.class, RecommendedItemsWritable.class,
             SequenceFileOutputFormat.class); <-- text format in Mahout trunk

Should be able to choose format class from the params.
