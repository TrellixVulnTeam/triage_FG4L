It has occurred to me that in my commit of mahout-scala stuff, i haven't rebased packages onto o.a.m... as has been discussed. 

it also has occurred to me that putting that stuff into o.a.m.math in this case may create unwelcome interference between java and scala stuff. 

So I am moving scala math DSL stuff into 0.a.m.math.scalabindings package. It is awfully awkward compared to just "mahout.math" scala style package it bears now, but i guess modern IDE tools make it no problem to import.
