Seems that I have found a discrepancy of this implementation from the original Yehuda Koren's SVD++ algorithm.

line 140:
double denominator = Math.sqrt(itemsByUser.size());
should be
double denominator = Math.sqrt(itemsByUser.get(u).size());
line 164:
double denominator = Math.sqrt(itemsByUser.size());
should be
double denominator = Math.sqrt(itemsByUser.get(u).size());


The sum of y parameters should be normalized by square root of number of items for which user u provided implicit feedback. Am I right?
Currently, it is normalized by square root of number of users not items.
