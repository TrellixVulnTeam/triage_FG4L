For now we only have ',' and '\t' as delimiters, this is really not enough for users.

Of course users can overwritten processLine etc. to archive their goal(e.g. use four spaces as delimiter pattern), but as a well designed framework, Mahout should consider vary demands of most users and make it very easy to use.

Also, it will not cost much time to implement, can I push a patch on this ?
