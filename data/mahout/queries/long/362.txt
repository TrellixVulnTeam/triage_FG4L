Provides a map/reduce job to precompute the pairwise cosine similarities between the item vectors of the user-item-matrix.  

The code uses a slightly modified version of the algorithm suggested in "Elsayed et al: Pairwise Document Similarity in Large Collections with MapReduce" (http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/publications/Elsayed_etal_ACL2008_short.pdf)
