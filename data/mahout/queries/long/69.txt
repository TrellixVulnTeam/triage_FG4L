We need to figure out all the things that need to be done for a 0.1 release.

These include, but are not limited to:


	Legal issues (NOTICES.txt, license files, etc.)
	Documentation
	Wiki page on making releases (See Lucene or Solr wiki page on said topic)
	Release Managers should setup signatures
	Remaining issues to be resolved for 0.1.  We should go through the issues and make decisions by setting the fix version to be 0.1



Others?  I've personally never done an Apache release before, so we will want to take our time and make sure things are right.
