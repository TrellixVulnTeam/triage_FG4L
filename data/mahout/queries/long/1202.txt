Vector assign() and aggregate() can be significantly improved in some conditions taking into account the different properties of the vectors we're working with.

This issue relates to the design document at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g1PjUuvjyh2LBdq2_rKLIcUiDbeOORA1sCJiSsz-JVU/edit#heading=h.koi571fvwha3jj

and the patch at
https://reviews.apache.org/r/10669

The benchmarks are at
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AochdzPoBmWodG9RTms1UG40YlNQd3ByUFpQY0FLWmc&pli=1#gid=10

and while there are a few regressions (which will be fixed later regarding RandomAccessSparseVectors), it improves a lot of benchmarks as well as cleans up the code significantly.

Part 1, the new function interfaces is merged. [Committed revision 1478853.]
