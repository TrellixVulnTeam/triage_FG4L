ParallelALSFactorizationJob set job name per each iteration in different with logger`s info. job name start from 2 and numIterations is 0 based. therefore if I run job with iteration 5, job names start from "Recompute M, iteration (2/5)". It would be better if we set job name same as logger info message since current job name could be confusing.
