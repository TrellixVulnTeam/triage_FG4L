The current ClusterDumper utility takes a sequence file and points file as input and prints the cluster vector along with the points that belong to the clusters in the sequence file. This utility doesn't produce correct results in case there are multiple sequence files and points. 

To avoid this problem, all the point to cluster mappings need to be read first and then iterate on the sequence files.
