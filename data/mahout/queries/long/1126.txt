On the Mac you have to remove the licenses in the mahout jar or hadoop can't unjar mahout. The Mac has a case insensitive file system and so can't tell the difference between LICENSE and license. This was fixed at one point https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-780

zip -d mahout/examples/target/mahout-examples-0.8-SNAPSHOT-job.jar META-INF/license/
zip -d mahout/examples/target/mahout-examples-0.8-SNAPSHOT-job.jar META-INF/LICENSE/

Looks like as is mentioned in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-780 

mv target/maven-shared-archive-resources/META-INF/LICENSE target/maven-shared-archive-resources/META-INF/LICENSES

works too.

Can this get a permanent fix?
