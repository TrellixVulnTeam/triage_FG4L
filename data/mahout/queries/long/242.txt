Identifies interesting Collocations in text using ngrams scored via the LogLikelihoodRatio calculation. 

As discussed in:

Current form is a tar of a maven project that depends on mahout. Build as usual with 'mvn clean install', can be executed using:


mvn -e exec:java  -Dexec.mainClass="org.apache.mahout.colloc.CollocDriver" -Dexec.args="--input src/test/resources/article --colloc target/colloc --output target/output -w"



Output will be placed in target/output and can be viewed nicely using:


sort -rn -k1 target/output/part-00000



Includes rudimentary unit tests. Please review and comment. Needs more work to get this into patch state and integrate with Robin's document vectorizer work in MAHOUT-237

Some basic TODO/FIXME's include:

	use mahout math's ObjectInt map implementation when available
	make the analyzer configurable
	better input validation + negative unit tests.
	more flexible ways to generate units of analysis (n-1)grams.
