Added a patch which allows you to run the $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop command script through the bin/mahout script.
This way the Mahout script adds the Mahout classes to the $HADOOP_CLASSPATH so you can view sequencefiles generated by Mahout jobs with

bin/mahout hadoop fs -text <sequencefile>

without having to specify Mahout classes manually or getting ClassNotFoundExceptions
