Per MAHOUT-881, it would be nice to implement a easy to use test driver (CFLoadEvaluationRunner) that can take in a data model for CF and run the LoadEvaluator multiple times and bring back stats about how long it took to run, etc.  This likely means being able to return the StatsCallable results out to the runner, but doesn't have to.
