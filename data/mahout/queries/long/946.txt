I've run into a few places in Mahout where mapreduce jobs can fail and their status won't be checked, so processing will continue on.  This sometimes obscures the root problem.  I've tracked down a bunch of places where this problem exists, and tried to fix the code to do something reasonable (return -1 status code, throw exception, etc.) when jobs fail.
