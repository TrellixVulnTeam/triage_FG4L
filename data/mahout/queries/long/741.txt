Distributed computation of the local clustering coefficient of the vertices of an undirected graph. The local clustering coefficient is a measure for the "connectedness" of a vertex in its neighborhood and is computed by dividing the number of closed triangles with a vertex neighbors by the number of possible triangles of this vertex with it's neighbours.

This measure is easy to compute when we already have enumerated the triangles of the graph.
