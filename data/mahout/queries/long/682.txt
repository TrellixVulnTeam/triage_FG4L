The current implementation of LDA outputs only topics and their words. Many applications need the p(z|d) values of a document to use this vector as a reduced representation of the document (dimensionality reduction of document). We need to introduce a new key which would keep track of the gamma values for each document (as obtained from the document.infer() method) and writes these to the output stream and finally, PrintLDATopics should output these values per document id. Also, outputting the probabilities of words in a topic would also provide a more meaningful output.
