Nathan Halko contacted me and pointed out importance of availability of power iterations and their significant effect on accuracy of smaller eigenvalues and noise attenuation. 

Essentially, we would like to introduce yet another job parameter, q, that governs amount of optional power iterations. The suggestion how to modify the algorithm is outlined here : https://github.com/dlyubimov/ssvd-lsi/wiki/Power-iterations-scratchpad .

Note that it is different from original power iterations formula in the paper in the sense that additional orthogonalization performed after each iteration. Nathan points out that that improves errors in smaller eigenvalues a lot (If i interpret it right).
