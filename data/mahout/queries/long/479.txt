Opening this JIRA issue to collect ideas on how to streamline our classification and clustering algorithms to make integration for users easier as per mailing list thread http://markmail.org/message/pnzvrqpv5226twfs


Jake and Robin and I were talking the other evening and a common lament was that our classification (and clustering) stuff was all over the map in terms of data structures.  Driving that to rest and getting those comments even vaguely as plug and play as our much more advanced recommendation components would be very, very helpful.

This issue probably also realates to MAHOUT-287 (intention there is to make naive bayes run on vectors as input).

Ted, Jake, Robin: Would be great if someone of you could add a comment on some of the issues you discussed "the other evening" and (if applicable) any minor or major changes you think could help solve this issue.
