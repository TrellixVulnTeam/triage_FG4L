Hi, Mukai
  Thanks for your efforts in expand the RF to regression. However, I have a doubt about your implementation regarding to Regressionsplit.java. The variance method 
"
 private static double variance(double[] s, double[] ss, double[] dataSize) {
    double var = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
      if (dataSize[i] > 0) 
{
        var += ss[i] - ((s[i] * s[i]) / dataSize[i]);
      }
    }
    return var;
  }
"

While the variance in my mind should be something like 
var += ss[i]/dataSize[i] - ((s[i] * s[i]) / (dataSize[i]*dataSize[i]));

Please help correct me if I am wrong. Thanks
