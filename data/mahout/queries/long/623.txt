I actually stumbled on the fact that SSVD code doesn't have 'overwrite results' option. Which might not be not a big deal if it weren't for the fact that it also turns out to be the default behavior as well (i.e. by default it would overwrite target path if it already exists). Which promotes it to a verge of a bug. 

I think i need to attend to it by introducing overwrite option and disabling this by default. (i.e. by default it would fail if the output path already exists). I think this is consistent with some other CLI in Mahout I saw.
