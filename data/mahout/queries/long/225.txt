Per discussion on the dev list, this patch renames:

o.a.m.matrix -> o.a.m.math
o.a.m.jet -> o.a.m.math.jet

Things currently under o.a.m.matrix would retain their existing names,
with s/matrix/math, for example:

o.a.m.math.bitvector
o.a.m.math.buffer
o.a.m.math.function
o.a.m.math.list
o.a.m.math.map
o.a.m.math.matrix

The maven submodule is changed from mahout-matrix to mahout-math

Apply this patch with -E to delete empty files, and then 'svn delete matrix' and 'svn add math' â€“ I couldn't figure out how to get patch to set that up automatically.

Verified that patch applies cleanly to r890796, build completes and unit tests work.
