When I run mahout kmeans or the MahoutDriver with a kmeans.props that has all required parameters filled in and contains:

cl|clustering= true

I will get the following error message in the log: SEVERE: Unexpected true while processing Job-Specific Options

Running kmeans and specifying -cl or --clustering does work however.
