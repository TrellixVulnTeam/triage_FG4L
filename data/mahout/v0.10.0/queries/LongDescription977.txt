This is a suggested improvement to PlusAnonymousUserDataModel. 

Currently the ID of the anonymous user is fixed to Long.MIN_VALUE. Only one set
of temp data can be inserted into the model and used at one time.

I propose the change to enable multiple users to insert into this
model concurrently in a thread-safe manner.

The idea is to define a pool of available anonymous user IDs. Every
time a new anonymous user makes a request, the next available
TEMP_USER_ID is pulled from the queue. After recommendations are
retrieved, the TEMP_USER_ID can be returned to the pool.
