The RF classifier has as a Describe utility which figures out a description of a data set (how many attributes, types, and enumerated values, etc...) and writes this meta-data to file for later use during training or testing.

The file format is binary.  That means the only way to generate it is with the Describe utility and it is hard to modify.  If the format was human readable it is then possible to modify/generate the meta-data by hand.

This will also make it easier to support standard formats such as ARFF.
