Vector and it's implementations could use a few things:

1. DenseVector should implement equals and hashCode similar to SparseVector
2. The VectorView asFormatString() is not compatible with actually recreating any type of vector.  
3. Add tests to VectorTest that assert that decodeFormat/asFormatString is able to do a round trip.
4. Add static AbstractVector.equivalent(Vector, Vector) that takes in two vectors and compares them for equality, regardless of their implementation.
