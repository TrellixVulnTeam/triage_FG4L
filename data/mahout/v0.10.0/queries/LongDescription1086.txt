Something changed in Mahout around 9/6/12 that caused TestMeanShift.testCanopyEuclideanMRJobNoClustering to return 4 clusters rather than 3. All of the other tests using the same data still return 3 clusters. No changes were made to any of the MeanShiftCanopy classes other than 1 formatting change to the driver so I'm at a loss to the cause.
