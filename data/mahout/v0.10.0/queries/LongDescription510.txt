At the moment this is tracking a broader concern: to standardize as much as possible how we approach serialization. The long-term goal is notionally to use the following "encodings" as the input/output of Mahout stuff, and by extension, probably internally too.


	Text
	Vector Writable
	(maybe Avro)



not


	Serializable
	GSON / JSON
