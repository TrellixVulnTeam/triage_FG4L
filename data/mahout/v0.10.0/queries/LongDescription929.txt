The current clustering drivers have a -cp option to produce clusteredPoints directory containing the input vectors classified by the final clusters produced by the algorithm. These options are redundantly implemented in those drivers.


	Factor out & implement an independent post processor to perform the classification step independently of the various clustering implementations.




	Implement a pluggable outlier removal capability for this classifier.




	Consider building off of the ClusterClassifier & ClusterIterator ideas.
