org.apache.mahout.text.ChunkedWriter has a bug, that causes data loss, if the maximal chunk size is reached. The first chunk is overwritten, then it continues normally.


This is caused in line 58:
writer = new SequenceFile.Writer(fs, conf, getPath(currentChunkID++), Text.class, Text.class);

The fix should look like this:
writer = new SequenceFile.Writer(fs, conf, getPath(++currentChunkID), Text.class, Text.class);
