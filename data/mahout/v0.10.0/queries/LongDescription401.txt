In seq2sparse, TFIDFPartialVectorReducer and TFPartialVectorReducer should write NamedVectors. It appears that a lack of labels on the vector input to k-means at least breaks the cluster-dumper in the sense that it no longer prints the original document ids for points.

See: http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/where-are-the-points-in-each-cluster-kmeans-clusterdump-td838683.html#a845600

I wonder if this is also an issue with the code that generates vectors from lucene indexes?
