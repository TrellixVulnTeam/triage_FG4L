DataModel has a method getNumUsersWithPreferenceFor(long... itemIDs). It does what it says. However I think this is a suboptimal API (for which we have me to blame).


	All calls to this involve 1 or 2 arguments only
	No implementation supports more than 2 arguments, which makes the signature misleading
	All implementations internally have some logic like "if it's 1, do X, if it's args, do Y, otherwise fail"
	Calling this method, which happens frequently, always incurs the overhead of allocating a long[]



The change is simple: make this two methods, with one and two args respectively. Implementations would then just split their current implementation into these two methods.

There is no API change for callers, at all, if invoked with 1 or 2 args. I assume callers are not trying 3+ args now, as it has never been supported.
It does involve a straightforward change to implementors of DataModel.
