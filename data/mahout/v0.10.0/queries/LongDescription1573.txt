(1) add minSplit parameter pass-thru to drmFromHDFS to be able to explicitly increase parallelism. 

(2) add parrallelism readjustment parameter to a checkpoint() call. This implies shuffle-less coalesce() translation to the data set before it is requested to be cached (if specified).

Going forward, we probably should try and figure how we can automate it,  at least a little bit. For example, the simplest automatic adjustment might include re-adjust parallelims on load to simply fit cluster size (95% or 180% of cluster size, for example), with some rule-of-thumb safeguards here, e.g. we cannot exceed a factor of say 8 (or whatever we configure) in splitting each original hdfs split. We should be able to get a reasonable parallelism performance out of the box on simple heuristics like that.
