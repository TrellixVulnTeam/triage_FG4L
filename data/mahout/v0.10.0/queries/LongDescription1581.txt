I put in some tests to ensure that the SRM.times method stays relatively fast and doesn't revert to the old dense behavior.  These are inherently timeout based since there is no way to count operations.

I will extend the timeout another 10x.  The failing version of the test takes hours or more so this should still catch any regressions.
