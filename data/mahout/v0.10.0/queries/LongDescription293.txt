Objective is to add more tunable parameters to the PFPGrowth algorithm.

From Neal on Mahout User list:

I often use Christian Borgelt's itemset implementations for playing
with data.  He's implemented a nice set of switches, see below.
Setting a minimum support threshold and mimimum itemset size are both
convenient and tend to make the algorithm run a bit faster.

-m#      minimal number of items per item set (default: 1)
-n#      maximal number of items per item set (default: no limit)
-s#      minimal support of an item set (default: 10%)
        (positive: percentage, negative: absolute number)
-d#      minimal binary logarithm of support quotient (default: none)
-p#      output format for the item set support (default: "%.1f")
-a       print absolute support (number of transactions)
-g       write output in scanable form (quote certain characters)
-q#      sort items w.r.t. their frequency (default: -2)
        (1: ascending, -1: descending, 0: do not sort,
         2: ascending, -2: descending w.r.t. transaction size sum)
-u       use alternative tree projection method
-z       do not prune tree projections to bonsai
-j       use quicksort to sort the transactions (default: heapsort)
-i#      ignore records starting with a character in the given string
-b/f/r#  blank characters, field and record separators
        (default: " \t\r", " \t", "\n")
