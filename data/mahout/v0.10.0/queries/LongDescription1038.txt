@public Long getPreferenceTime(long userID, long itemID) throws TasteException 
there is a prepareStatement of getPreferenceSQL, should it be getPreferenceTimeSQL? because i found you check the getPreferenceTimeSQL null and log for getPreferenceTimeSQL, and this is an function of getPreferenceTime...
i didn't check relative code, so i am not sure it's a bug or just what you want.
