Much of the classification capabilities relies on parsing values out from the Text object just to determine what type of "thing" is being used.  We should try to avoid having to do string manipulation for this kind of thing and instead encapsulate it in Writable instances.  This should make things perform faster and bring stronger typing to the problem, which should make it easier to understand and debug the code.
