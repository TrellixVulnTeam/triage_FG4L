Implementations of Minkowski and Chebyshev distance measures. 
Minkowski distance is a generalization of the L-space measures, where L1 is Manhattan distance and L2 is Euclidean distance. Uses Math.pow to calculate coordinate distances. Math.pow has a fast-path for integer-valued arguments, so Minkowski with 3.0 is much faster than Minkowski with 3.1.

Chebyshev distance is "chessboard" distance, based on the moves that a king can make: any direction include diagonals. The Manhattan or taxicab distances can only traverse in right angles.
