I have added those two jobs to the MahoutDriver and made them accept shortcut names for the currently existing similarity implementations, so that users do not have to supply the full classname (e.g. you can call the job now with -s tanimoto-coefficient instead of -s org.apache.mahout.math.hadoop.similarity.vector.DistributedTanimotoCoefficientVectorSimilarity)
