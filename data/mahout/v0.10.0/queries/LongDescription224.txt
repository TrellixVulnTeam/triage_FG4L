In preparation for the binary release work described in MAHOUT-215, here's a minor patch that does some some cleanup on the poms. 

The hadoop and junit dependency versions are now established using the dependencyManagement section of the parent pom in mahout/maven/pom.xml

A large number of transitive dependencies from the hadoop pom are now excluded there as well – these were not necessary previously because the hadoop dependency was hand-rolled and did not include them. With the update to the hadoop 0.20.2-SNAPSHOT, they now become required.

Also, the parent pom no longer has mahout/pom.xml as its parent, this allows binary packaging to be performed in mahout/pom.xml after the build of all of the other sub-modules is complete.

Also, removed the javamail dependency – was there a reason this was present?

Verified that build and unit tests complete.
