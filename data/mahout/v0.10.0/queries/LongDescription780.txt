Dan explains it well below. The workaround is to make the 'license' folder into a 'licenses' folder, but, where does this come from? anyone know?


With SVN 'At revision 1152597.', and freshly rebuilt:

jar -tvf /Users/danbri/Documents/workspace/trunk/examples/target/mahout-examples-0.6-SNAPSHOT-job.jar


 grep -i license

This situation seems to quite confuse Hadoop. The underlying OSX
filesystem doesn't support file and directory names differing only by
case; see http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Java/Conceptual/Java14Development/01-JavaOverview/JavaOverview.html

mahout  lucene.vector --dir solr/data/index/ --output bar/vecs --field

Running on hadoop, using HADOOP_HOME=/Users/danbri/working/hadoop/hadoop-0.20.2

Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: Mkdirs failed to

That Hadoop error message is somewhat unhelpful, especially for those
who doubt their hadoop knowhow; but technically correct. The
/tmp/hadoop and its subdirectory exist and are writeable. The problem
is the specific file/dir names being written into it. That wasn't so
obvious. So I went chasing around configuring hadoop tmp dirs,
checking it existed and was writable in local and in hdfs dirs, ...
then ... I finally, belatedly tried unzipping the jar with 'jar -xvf '
to see what was special about 'license', and got the same error from
commandline 'jar' that upset !file.getParentFile().isDirectory() in
Hadoop's ./src/core/org/apache/hadoop/util/RunJar.java:

java.io.IOException: license : could not create directory
       at sun.tools.jar.Main.extractFile(Main.java:909)
       at sun.tools.jar.Main.extract(Main.java:852)
       at sun.tools.jar.Main.run(Main.java:242)
       at sun.tools.jar.Main.main(Main.java:1149)

(this is the same error that trips up hadoop)

This seems to be reproducible; I did an svn up, mvn clean and mvn
package, let all the tests run and pass, and confirm that the same
thing happens.

I compared an early job .jar from 0.5, where all was fine. Any
suggestions for best quick fix?
