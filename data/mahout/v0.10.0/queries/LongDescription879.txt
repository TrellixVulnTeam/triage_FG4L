As discussed on the mailinglist we will remove the graph algorithms from Mahout (except PageRank). It has become pretty clear that the Map/Reduce is not suitable for most "classic" graph algorithms.

I will attach a file containing the code of all algorithms that will be removed so that they don't get lost.
