Users of Canopy clustering report that the single reducer used in the mapreduce version often takes dispropportately long to process the results of multiple mappers. This patch introduces a new Canopy CLI argument, cf (-clusterFilter), which if present establishes a lower bound on the numPoints of canopies output from the algorithm. The default value for this filter is 0, and all canopies are output. Setting -cf 1 would eliminate any canopies which contain only 1 point from subsequent processing steps.
