There are several links on the website that point to absent pages. I just
clicked on all the link present on page :
http://mahout.apache.org/users/basics/quickstart.html

And those links are broken :
http://mahout.apache.org/users/basics/recommender-documentation.html
http://mahout.apache.org/users/classification/partial-implementation.html
http://mahout.apache.org/users/basics/TasteCommandLine
http://mahout.apache.org/users/recommender/recommendationexamples.html
http://mahout.apache.org/users/basics/parallel-frequent-pattern-mining.html
http://mahout.apache.org/users/basics/mahout.ga.tutorial.html
http://hadoop.apache.org.html/

That's just the ones I found in 2 minutes on the quickstart page, there are maybe other dead links elsewhere.
