The following Mahout programs incorrectly processed -h flags, throwing OptionExceptions:

seq2sparse
seqdirectory
seqwiki
svd
trainclassifier
transpose

The first five are easily addressed by adding "parser.setHelpOption(helpOpt)" in the correct driver files (thanks to Jeff Eastman). The "transpose" program also contained a NullPointerException thrown when two integer arguments were not verified. See the patch file for a possible fix.
