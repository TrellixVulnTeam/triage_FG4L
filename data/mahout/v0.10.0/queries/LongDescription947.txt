I've put together a few handy additions to seqdumper:


	Ability to dump all sequence files in a directory.
	A quiet flag to attenuate the non-data output.
	A flag to toggle name-only printing for NamedVector values.
	An option to only print the N highest-valued elements in WeightedVector values



Seems like others will probably find some of these to be helpful.
