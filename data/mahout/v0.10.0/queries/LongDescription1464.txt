Create a version of Cooccurrence Analysis (RowSimilarityJob with LLR) that runs on Spark. This should be compatible with Mahout Spark DRM DSL so a DRM can be used as input. 

Ideally this would extend to cover MAHOUT-1422. This cross-cooccurrence has several applications including cross-action recommendations.
