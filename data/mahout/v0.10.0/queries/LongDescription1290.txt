When running jetty:run under mahout-integration, seeing a ClassNotFoundException:
 org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.*example.grouplens.*GroupLensRecommender.

The problem is happening because the webapp
folder wasn't moved to the examples dir and the Jetty dependency wasn't added asa Maven plugin when the GroupLens example moved to the examples submodule.
