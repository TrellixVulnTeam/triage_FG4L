Add a parameter to MinHash clustering that specifies the dimension of vector to hash (indexes or values). Current version of MinHash clustering only hashed values of vectors. Based on discussion on dev-mahout list, both of the use-cases are possible and frequently met in practice. 
Preserve backward compatibility with default dimension set to values. Add new unit tests.
