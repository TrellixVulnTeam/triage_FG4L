CsvRecordFactory uses very simplistic CSV parsing, and incorrectly parses CSV strings when there are double-quoted fields with commas present.

This problem also affects the command-line demo programs which use CsvRecordFactory (mostly the sgd-related programs).

Attached is a patch to fix the problem.
