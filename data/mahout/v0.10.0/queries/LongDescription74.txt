Fuzzy KMeans clustering algorithm is an extension to traditional K Means clustering algorithm and performs soft clustering.

More details about fuzzy k-means can be found here :http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_clustering#Fuzzy_c-means_clustering

I have implemented fuzzy K-Means prototype and tests in org.apache.mahout.clustering.fuzzykmeans
