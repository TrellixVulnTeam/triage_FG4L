The ability to assign a computed value to a Vector using a BinaryFunction and a constant argument would be useful for the Dirichlet Process Clustering algorithm under investigation. Specifically:

interface Vector {
...
public Vector assign(BinaryFunction f, double v);

...
}

and a new public class TimesFunction implements BinaryFunction too.
