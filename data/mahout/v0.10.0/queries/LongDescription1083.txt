the function "reduce" in mahout-0.7-kmeans-CIReducer.java doesn't work well as it looks like.

  protected void reduce(IntWritable key, Iterable<ClusterWritable> values, Context context) throws IOException,
      InterruptedException {
    Iterator<ClusterWritable> iter = values.iterator();
    ClusterWritable first = null;
    while (iter.hasNext()) {
      ClusterWritable cw = iter.next();
      if (first == null) 
{
        first = cw;
      }
 else 
{
        first.getValue().observe(cw.getValue());
      }
    }
    List<Cluster> models = new ArrayList<Cluster>();
    models.add(first.getValue());
    classifier = new ClusterClassifier(models, policy);
    classifier.close();
    context.write(key, first);
  }




Apparentlyï¼Œ the variable "first" will collect all output data of maps. Actually but, the value of "first" will change after the code "ClusterWritable cw = iter.next();", same with this new variable "cw"! I don't why but running result shows that the code runs looks like this:"ClusterWritable cw = first = iter.next();".
is "cw" a reference a to "iter"?
is "iter.next" just change the value of "iter" itself to the next?
