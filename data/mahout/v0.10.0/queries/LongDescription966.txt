 After running the post processor the number of points that each cluster contains is not matching the number of points each cluster should contain as stated by clusterdumper.

MSV-287
{ n=90 c=[0.05195, 0.05675, 0.07151, 0.05713, 0.06946,...}
MSV-145
{ n=90 c=[0.93685, 0.93071, 0.93641, 0.94629, 0.94409,..}
the n mentioned in clusters-n-final against each cluster is different from the number of points actually contained in d directory for each cluster. Any idea why is this happening ...?
