I will attach to this issue a tarball containing my proposed contribution of the Taste project to Mahout. I think it's been scrubbed, repackaged, reformatted, cleaned up, and generally prepared for easy integration into Mahout. In particular I made many optional dependencies truly optional, so the core distro is quite lean.

The MD5 hash of the tarball is db78114f9799905c7d4a5a1907a03e6f
