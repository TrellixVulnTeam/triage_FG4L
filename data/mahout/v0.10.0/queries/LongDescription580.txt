I found the following issue in the trunk: If the dataSource option is "hdfs"
in org.apache.mahout.classifier.
Classify, there is a problem with InMemoryBayesDatastore because its
basePath param is not defined :
To fix it, I edited Classify like this:
122.  if ("hdfs".equals(dataSource)) {
123.    params.set("basePath", modelBasePath);

Yes, looks like InMemoryDataStore expects this to be set â€“ so does HBaseDataStore. But that takes the base path (table) separately as a param. And InMemoryDataStore doesn't take it at all. I adjusted this since it seems correct. And then tried to centralized handling of Bayes params in BayesParameters since it seems to get half processed in this class only.

I have attached my own rather more elaborate patch that reflects this.
