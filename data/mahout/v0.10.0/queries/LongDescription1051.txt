Based upon our conversation with Jake in the user-list, I have modified the o.a.m.clustering.lda.cvb.InMemoryCollapsedVariationalBayes0.loadVectors so that it does not ignore document ids in input. To preserve backwards compatibility, it behaves as it did earlier if a ClassCastException is thrown; which occurs when ids are not integers, and/or the document vector (or getDelegate() if it is a NamedVector) cannot be cast to a RandomAccessSparseVector.
