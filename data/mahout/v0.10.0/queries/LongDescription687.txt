Problems:

	The uncommons RepeatableRNG classes are the basis of RandomUtils.
	
		These classes cheerfully ignore setSeed.
	
	
	Some people in the project want to move off Uncommons anyway.



This patch uses the org.apache.commons.math.random.RandomGenerator classes instead of org.apache.uncommons.maths.RepeatableRNG classes.
