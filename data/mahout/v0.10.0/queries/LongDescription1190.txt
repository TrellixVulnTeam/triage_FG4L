Currently when calling .assign() on a SASV with another vector and a custom function, it will iterate through it and assign every single entry while also referring it by index.

This makes the process hugely expensive. (on a run of BallKMeans on the 20 newsgroups data set, profiling reveals that 92% of the runtime was spent updating assigning the vectors).

Here's a prototype patch:
