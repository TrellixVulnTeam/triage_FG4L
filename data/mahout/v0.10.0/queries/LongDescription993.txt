I ran VectorDumper from the command line like this:

$MAHOUT_HOME/bin/mahout vectordump -i $
{HDFS_VECTS}
 --csv -p > $
{LOCAL_VECTS}

I've used this command before to dump similar vectors, but I'm now getting missing argument errors:

ERROR common.AbstractJob: Missing value(s) --printKey

You can add an argument after each of these flags to work around this problem for now:

$MAHOUT_HOME/bin/mahout vectordump -i $
{INPATH}
 --csv x -p x > $
{LOCAL_OUT}

I encountered this on the trunk, but I think it's likely this problem went out in 0.6; I can check in the next fews days if nobody does it first.
