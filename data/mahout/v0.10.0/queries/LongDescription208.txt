SparseVector and DenseVector both cache the value of lengthSquared, so that subsequent calls to it get the cached value.  Great, except the cache is never cleared - calls to set/setQuick or assign or anything, all leave the cached value unchanged.  

Mutating method calls should set lengthNorm to -1 so that the cache is cleared.

This could be a really nasty bug if hit.
