This is similar to the same reasoning behind the fix for MAHOUT-957.  The desired output is term frequency vectors, but I want terms filtered by their min and max DF values. This might be valid in LDA, where tf vectors is desired for input, but filtering out the maxDFPercent is also useful.

Currently minDF and maxDFPercent are only used when calculating tfidf, and the original tv vectors are not updated to represent the term filtering.
