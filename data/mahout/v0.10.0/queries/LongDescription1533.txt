As per (second discussion) on the mailinglist, we'll remove Frequent Pattern Mining due to lack of usage and maintenance. This was already intended for the 0.9 release, but a user stepped up promising to take care of the algorithm (but never cam back to work on it).

The source code for the latest version of Frequent Pattern Mining will always be available in our svn: https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/mahout/tags/mahout-0.9/core/src/main/java/org/apache/mahout/fpm/
