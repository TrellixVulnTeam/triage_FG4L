It would be useful if the KMeans, FuzzyKMeans would specify the last cluster iteration folder with a pattern such as 'cluster-n-last'.

At the moment it is difficult to configure other programs to process clustering results since the number of actual iterations is not known up front.

A PathFilder similar to ClustersFilter could be created which filters folders on the pattern 'cluster-*-last' in order to determine the folder.
