Hi all, just started checking out the code base to get familiar with it and turned loose IntelliJ on the code. It picked up a few possible issues I thought I'd highlight:


MatrixView:57

      for (int col = offset[COL]; col < offset[COL] + cardinality[COL]; row++)

Pretty sure that should be col++ at the end.


DenseMatrix:122

Instances are compared uisng == instead of equals(). Doesn't matter if this is exactly the semantics you want, but if DenseMatrix ever defined a notion of equals() this wouldn't use it and might be a bug. Same in many other classes.


Canopy:146, 168

      pointStronglyBound = pointStronglyBound | (dist < t2);

Should this really be a non-shortcircuit, versus

       pointStronglyBound = pointStronglyBound || (dist < t2);

or just

       if (!pointStronglyBound) 
{
              pointStronglyBound = dist < t2;
       }


CanopyDriver:52,53

String.valueOf is a smidge faster than "" + x.


Actually I've got several more but they're less important, like redundant casts or utility classes without private constructors, etc. I can keep going here... want to help polish a few things but don't want to get overbearing.
