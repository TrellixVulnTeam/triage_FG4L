when using mahout lda for topic modeling, creating vectors from SequenceFile is essential, (refer to https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAHOUT/Creating+Vectors+from+Text) but when the --minSupport was set a little bit larger, I found the term counting not right â€” there is a logical error at org.apache.mahout.vectorizer.DictionaryVectorizer.java:line 335
    job.setCombinerClass(TermCountReducer.class);

Now turn to line 41 at org.apache.mahout.vectorizer.term.TermCountReducer.java
    if (sum >= minSupport) 
{
      context.write(key, new LongWritable(sum));
    }

so some terms would be filtered at Combiner even though they actually could pass through, absolutely this is not what we've expected.
