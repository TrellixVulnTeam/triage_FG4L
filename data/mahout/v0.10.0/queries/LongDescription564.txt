While running KMeansClusterer#runKMeansIteration sequentially I noticed that the distanceThreshold parameter is not used. The convergenceDelta field is used instead. However, it's initialized at 0 and only set when creating a KMeansClusterer with a Configuration object, which is only used in a MapReduce setting.
