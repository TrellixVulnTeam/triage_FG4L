I ran the NSL-KDD data set (http://nsl.cs.unb.ca/NSL-KDD/) through the ARFF integration.  The process failed to parse the arff formatted file.  The file has quoted identifiers:

@relation 'KDDTrain-20Percent'
@attribute 'duration' real
@attribute 'protocol_type' 
{'tcp','udp', 'icmp'}
 

The quotes caused the problem.  The "official" arff BNF shows that quotes should be supported:
