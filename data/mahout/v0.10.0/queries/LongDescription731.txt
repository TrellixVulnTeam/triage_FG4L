I'm thinking to work on a patch that adds SQL92JDBCDataModel based on the sample code of PostgreSQLJDBCDataModel. This class will only use standard SQL92. It won't be high performance, but would have maximum compatibility to other popular DBMS, such as Oracle, SQLlite, etc. This is quite important to Drupal/Mahout integration.

Before I actually write the code, is there any suggestions or concerns? Thanks!
