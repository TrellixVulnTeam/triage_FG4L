Hi all,

while trying to understand the clusterdump utility, I encountered a message "no HADOOP_CONF_DIR or HADOOP_HOME set, running locally". As per some of the discussions in Apr'10 (http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/Dealing-with-kmean-and-meanshift-output-td708824.html#a709066), it would be good to default the hadoop conf directory to hadoop_home/conf. 

So I've changed the script to accommodate this.
Existing code:
if [ "$HADOOP_CONF_DIR" = "" ] || [ "$HADOOP_HOME" = "" ] || [ "$MAHOUT_LOCAL" != "" ] ; then
  if [ "$HADOOP_CONF_DIR" = "" ] || [ "$HADOOP_HOME" = "" ] ; then
    echo "no HADOOP_CONF_DIR or HADOOP_HOME set, running locally"
  elif [ "$MAHOUT_LOCAL" != "" ] ; then 
    echo "MAHOUT_LOCAL is set, running locally"
  fi
  exec "$JAVA" $JAVA_HEAP_MAX $MAHOUT_OPTS -classpath "$CLASSPATH" $CLASS "$@"
else
  echo "running on hadoop, using HADOOP_HOME=$HADOOP_HOME and HADOOP_CONF_DIR=$HADOOP_CONF_DIR"

New code:
if [ "$HADOOP_HOME" = "" ] || [ "$MAHOUT_LOCAL" != "" ] ; then
  if [ "$HADOOP_HOME" = "" ] ; then
    echo "no HADOOP_HOME set, running locally"
  elif [ "$MAHOUT_LOCAL" != "" ] ; then 
    echo "MAHOUT_LOCAL is set, running locally"
  fi
  exec "$JAVA" $JAVA_HEAP_MAX $MAHOUT_OPTS -classpath "$CLASSPATH" $CLASS "$@"
else
  if [ "$HADOOP_CONF_DIR" = "" ] ; then
    HADOOP_CONF_DIR=$HADOOP_HOME/conf
    echo "no HADOOP_CONF_DIR set. so defaulting HADOOP_CONF_DIR to $HADOOP_HOME/conf "
  fi
echo "running on hadoop, using HADOOP_HOME=$HADOOP_HOME and HADOOP_CONF_DIR=$HADOOP_CONF_DIR"

In my local machine, I've just set HADOOP_HOME and the script defaults the $HADOOP_CONF_DIR directory and runs on hadoop.
If this issue / fix looks valid, I'll open a JIRA issue and attach the patch.

Appreciate your thoughts / feedbacks,
Joe.

Agreed, and your solution looks good. I'll keep an eye out for the patch.

Good idea.  I thought we already did this...
