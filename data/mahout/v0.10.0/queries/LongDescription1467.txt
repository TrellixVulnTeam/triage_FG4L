The org.apache.mahout.clustering.classify.ClusterClassifier.readPolicy method leaks file handles.

This leak causes a serious problems in setups that reuse JVMs for multiple tasks (as with "mapred.job.reuse.jvm.num.tasks").

In more detail:
The org.apache.mahout.clustering.classify.ClusterClassifier class has  static methods to read policies: readPolicy.

It opens a SequenceFile.Reader and reads from it, and then neglects to close it.

suggested fix:
add a call to reader.close() before the return statement in readPolicy
