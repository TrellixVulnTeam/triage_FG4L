Patch to enable the following usecase:


	all preferences are kept in a text file and loaded via a FileDataModel
	at some point in time the text file is completely overwritten with more recent preferences
	an explicit refresh() on the FileDataModel is called



With the current FileDataModel, one could not see the new preferences as it would only have refreshed the whole file if that was modified more than one minute ago. And I don't want to wait that long to trigger the explicit refresh.

The patch makes the interval configurable with keeping the old interval length as default.

Hope I understood the intention of the refreshing mechanism right.
