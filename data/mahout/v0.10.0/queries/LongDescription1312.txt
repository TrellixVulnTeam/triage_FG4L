According to documented org.apache.mahout.math.neighborhood.Searcher, public abstract List<WeightedThing<Vector>> search(Vector query, int limit) contract, limit should be the number of results to return.

LocalitySensitiveHashSearch implements Searcher but does not respect that contract, as it can return more results than the given limit.

This issue was encountered while debugging MAHOUT-1302.
