As the Cloudera folk noted on the mailing list, the "i" option doesn't work for "-input" on RecommenderJob as the job actually overwrites "-i" to mean something else. We can fix that by removing the short name for this option. And removing similarly conflicting short names elsewhere.

Along the way I noticed how much code doesn't use standard input/output flags. I've tried to standardize as much of that as possible.
