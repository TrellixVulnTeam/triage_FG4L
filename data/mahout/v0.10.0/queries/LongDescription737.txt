I am sharing this Java implementation of mine that is based on the paper - Collaborative Filtering with Implicit Datasets. The implementation is multi-treading and can be easily extended to use it on Hadoop. In fact this approach would possibly work with non-implicit datasets, but further testing is needed. The algorithm is tried and tested on an implicit TV-viewing dataset, and the performance was pretty good (details to follow).
