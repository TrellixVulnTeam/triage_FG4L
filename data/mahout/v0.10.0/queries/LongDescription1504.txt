A new implementation of Naive Bayes was introduced in .7.  The weight (theta) normalization job was at least partially carried over but not fully implemented or enabled.  Weight normalization does not effect simple NB or CNB however enabling it will allow for all NB implementations in the Rennie et al. paper.
