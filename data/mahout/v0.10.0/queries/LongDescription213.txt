In the trunk, storeMapping is called always when toLongID() is called. In my opinion storeMapping should been called only in method initialize().
storeMapping will cost a lot when you use database to store the id mapping. I believe the code should like this:



  public void initialize(Iterable<String> stringIDs) throws TasteException {
    for (String stringID : stringIDs) {
      long longID = hash(stringID);
      storeMapping(longID, stringID);
    }
  }
