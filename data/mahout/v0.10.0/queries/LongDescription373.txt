Dumping term vectors with a dictionary using:

mahout vectordump -s vector-output/chunk-0 -dt sequencefile -d dictionary-output

gives me output like the following with no values, just the indexes expanded into their dictionary entries:




Name: 0001-11055 elts: {513:discard, 7199:empty,...



While dumping the same vector without a dictionary using

mahout vectordump -s vector-output/chunk-0

gives me output that includes indexes and values:



Name: 0001-11055 elts: {513:1.0, 7199:1.0...




Would it make sense for the dictionary based output to include values as well? Anyone opposed to modifying VectorHelper.vectorToString(Vector, String[]) to do so?
