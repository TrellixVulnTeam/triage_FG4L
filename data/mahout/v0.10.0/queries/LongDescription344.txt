Minhash clustering performs probabilistic dimension reduction of high dimensional data. The essence of the technique is to hash each item using multiple independent hash functions such that the probability of collision of similar items is higher. Multiple such hash tables can then be constructed  to answer near neighbor type of queries efficiently.
