Here's [1] an example of the problem (from BallKMeans, lines 225-232, [2]).

When iterating through the elements in a Multinomial and updating the probabilities, sometimes newWeight becomes 0 (because of using CosineDistances).
When setting a weight to 0 in Multinomial, the element is removed from the items hash map while using the hash map for iteration.
This causes a ConcurrentModificationException.
