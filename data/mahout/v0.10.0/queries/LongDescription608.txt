The top-level project directory has collected, over time, a number of directories that have a generally similar purpose: to collect various config files, data files, and scripts. In addition toWe have, at first glance:

bin/
 mahout
conf/
 (various .props files)
etc/
 build.xml (reusable  Ant tasks?)
 findbugs-exclude.xml
 mahout.importorder
mahout/
 conf/
  arff.vector.props (wrong place?)
src/
 main/
  appended-resources/
   META-INF/
    NOTICE
   supplemental-models.xml
 site/
  site.xml

There are a few top-level generated directories:

input/
 ...
output/
 ...
testdata/
 transactions
  test.txt


I'd like to prune whatever isn't needed anymore, and rationalize one directory structure as a start.
Can anyone help by suggesting things to be removed, or a directory structure?
