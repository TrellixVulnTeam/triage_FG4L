This issue tackles the LocalitySensitiveHashSearch, that was initially supposed to be part of MAHOUT-1156.

It adds HashedVector, the class that adds the LSH to vectors, a new searcher (although a better implementation is possible) and adds support in the existing tests and new StreamingKMeans infrastructure.
