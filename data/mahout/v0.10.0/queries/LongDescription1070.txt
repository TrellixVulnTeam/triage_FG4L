The org.apache.mahout.clustering.display.DisplayKMeans example class uses a value for k (numClusters) and maximum number of iterations to come to convergence, but their use is transposed (i.e. the numClusters is used as max iterations, and max iterations is used for numClusters). Furthermore, a second hard-coded version of the value is used. The end result is that it's not directly possible to experiment with different values of numClusters and maxIterations.
