I'm getting an OutOfMemoryError in EigenVerificationJob that seems to come from the following lines (200 - 204) that try to print the complete eigenvector to the console.


 
EigenVector ev = ...
log.info("appending {} to {}", ev, path);

 

Am I doing something wrong here? Or should we handle this somehow else? I don't want to use another loglevel because of this.
