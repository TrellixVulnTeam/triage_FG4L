The FileDataModel constructor checks for a null arg for dataFile, and a few other conditions, but not for an empty file.  If an empty file is passed in, it triggers a NullPointerException when the first line is evaluated.

For an empty file, an NPE is raised when firstLine.length() is called:

    FileLineIterator iterator = new FileLineIterator(dataFile, false);
    String firstLine = iterator.peek();
    while ((firstLine.length() == 0) || (firstLine.charAt(0) == COMMENT_CHAR)) {

Proposed fix is to add a check for a zero-length file:

    Preconditions.checkArgument(dataFile != null, "dataFile is null");
    if (!dataFile.exists() || dataFile.isDirectory()) 
{
      throw new FileNotFoundException(dataFile.toString());
    }
    Preconditions.checkArgument(dataFile.length() > 0L, "dataFile is empty");

A unit test has been included in the patch.
