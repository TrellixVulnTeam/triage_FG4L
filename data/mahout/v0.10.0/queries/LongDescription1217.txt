When updating a Centroid in StreamingKMeans, the Centroid needs to be removed and its updated version added.

When removing points in a searcher that are already there, sometimes the searcher fails to return the closest point (the one being searched for) causing a RuntimeException.

This has been observed for TF-IDF vectors with SquaredEuclideanDistance and CosineDistance and FastProjectionSearch.
