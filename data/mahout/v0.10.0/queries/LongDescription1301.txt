Realization of SequentialAccessSparseVector toString() method had changed in MAHOUT-1259 patch. Unfortunately, that patch introduced new bug: output of the toString() method had been changed - extra comma added at the end of the string

Example: 
Consider following sparse vector


Vector v = new SequentialAccessSparseVector(capacity);
v.set(1, 0.1);
v.set(3, 0.3);


In 0.7 v.toString() returns following string:


{1:0.1,3:0.3}


but in 0.8 it returns


{1:0.1,3:0.3,}


As you can see, there is extra comma at the end of the string.
