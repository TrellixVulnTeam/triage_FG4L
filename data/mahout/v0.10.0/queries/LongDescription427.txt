Once I resolved issue MAHOUT-426 , I was still not able to run the ./examples/bin/build-reuters.sh script without errors  These were ClassNotFoundExceptions, indicating a problem with the classpath.  

The issue appears to be related to the "-core" argument, which controls the classpath.  Placing '-core' as the first argument to the individual $MAHOUT_HOME/bin/mahout calls in the script solved the issue, but I'm not sure it was the correct solution.  It's unclear to me what the '-core' argument is supposed to signify.

Can someone shed some light on this, and tell me whether this is the correct solution to the problem?  And if not, what is the correct solution to this classpath issue.
