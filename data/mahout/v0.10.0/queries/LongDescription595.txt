Hi Mahouts,

I was missing source jars for mahout in my maven repository, so I'm adding a patch to this issue, which does the following:


	adds an <execution> to maven-source-plugin's configuration in /project/build/pluginManagement in the main pom.xml
	adds maven-source-plugin to core/pom.xml, examples/pom.xml, math/pom.xml and utils/pom.xml, without any further configuration.



for each mvn install or mvn deploy this will add an $
{artifactId}
-{$version}-sources.jar to the repository.
So Eclipse and other IDEs will be able to use those source jars to make "source-code-hopping" possible.

The given patch was created using revision 1063288.

Kind Regards,
Manuel Me√üner
