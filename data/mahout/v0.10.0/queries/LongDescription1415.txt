The clone method of the SparseMatrix class fails with a NullPointerException if there exists an empty row in the matrix which has not been explicitly set. The reason for this problem is that the clone operation iterates over all rows and clones them whether there exists a Vector instance for this row or not. The problem should be easily fixed by iterating only over the existing matrix slices.
