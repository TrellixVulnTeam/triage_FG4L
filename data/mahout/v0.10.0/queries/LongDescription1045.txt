With real world crawl data the Intra-cluster density from ClusterEvaluator is almost always NaN. The CDbw inter-cluster density is almost always 0. I have also seen several cases where CDbw fails to return any results but have not tracked down why yet.

I have sent a link to an 8G data set that reproduces these errors to Jeff Eastman.
