I'm currently working with the new Scala DSL and running into a problem with SparseMatrix and SparseRowMatrix.

The problem is that they don't implement a specialized assign(Matrix other, DoubleDoubleFunction f) function, but use the implementation from AbstractMatrix which loops through all  possible entries. 

We have to fix this asap.
