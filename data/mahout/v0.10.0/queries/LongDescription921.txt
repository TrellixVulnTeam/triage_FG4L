TransactionTree uses List<Integer> internally and as part of its API; this patch changes that and pushes the use of List<Integer> down to FPGrowth.java.  This can be converted if the perf bug can be fixed (MAHOUT-890).  I will also provide an alternate base FPGrowth implementation.

Please note that this patch assumes the patch attached to MAHOUT-920 has already been applied.
