org.apache.mahout.math.Sorting looks as if the original author borrowed from the Sun JRE, based on the private internal function names and contents. That code has a restrictive license. We need to take the equivalent file (java.util.Arrays) from Apache Harmony and use it as the basis for a clean replacement.

The problematic code are the quickSort and mergeSort functions, which extend 'Arrays' by supporting slices of arrays and custom sorting predicate functions. 

One might also wistfully note that the more recent JDKs from Sun have deployed different (and one hopes) better sort algorithms that 1.5 and/or Harmony, so a really energetic person might build implementations in here to match. However, expediency calls for just bashing on the Harmony implementation to solve the problem at hand.
