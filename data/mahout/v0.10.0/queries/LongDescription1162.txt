Adding BallKMeans and StreamingKMeans clustering algorithms.
These both implement Iterable<Centroid> and thus return the resulting centroids after clustering.

BallKMeans implements:

	kmeans++ initialization;
	a normal k-means pass;
	a trimming threshold so that points that are too far from the cluster they were assigned to are not used in the new centroid computation.



StreamingKMeans implements http://books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips24/NIPS2011_1271.pdf:

	an online clustering algorithm that takes each point into account one by one
	for each point, it computes the distance to the nearest existing cluster
	if the distance is greater than a set distanceCutoff, it will create a new cluster, otherwise it might be added to the cluster it's closest to (proportional to the value of the distance / distanceCutoff)
	if there are too many clusters, the clusters will be collapsed (the same method gets called, but the number of clusters is re-adjusted)
	finally, about as many clusters as requested are returned (not precise!); this represents a sketch of the original points.
