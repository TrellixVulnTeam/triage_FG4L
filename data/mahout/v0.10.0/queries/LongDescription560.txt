Currently SequenceFilesFromDirectory supports for conversion of texts to sequence file. The exact file (and potentially text from file) selection is not configurable. I'd like to re-use most of the conversion logic but change the exact text selection. (More information on what exactly I want to do: http://tinyurl.com/35pv8jg )

I slightly changed SequenceFilesFromDirectory to make that possible. (Added one additional optional parameter, but by default the current behaviour is used).
