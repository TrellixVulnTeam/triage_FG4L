Problem

When trying to build Mahout on a machine with a locale that uses a different decimal separator, org.apache.mahout.classifier.df.tools.VisualizerTest fails because of String assertions that are locale dependent.

Expected: humidity < 77.5 : yes
Actual: humidity < 77,5 : yes

Solution

Make assertions locale independent.
