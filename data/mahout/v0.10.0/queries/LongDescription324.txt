It looks to me the MapOutputValueClass is not set correctly in the method KMeansDrive.runClustering(...). , which doesn't match the OutputCollector used by the KMeansClusterMapper. Although it doesn't affect the output in the current implementation since the mapred.reduce.tasks is set to 0, it should be corrected.

Please confirm if this bug is valid.

Thanks.
