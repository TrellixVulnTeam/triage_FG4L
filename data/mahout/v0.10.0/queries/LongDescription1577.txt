We get warnings on every use of a non-final method in a constructor.  This is arguably slightly risky, but I haven't ever seen a bug from this.  Similarly, we haven't had any problems with long methods (inherent in Hadoop programs, I think) nor with putting literals after variables in comparisons.

I am going to turn these warnings off to decrease noise levels.
