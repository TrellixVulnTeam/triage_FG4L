There is a use case I encounter in which a random forest model is passed to remote server over a REST API and is used for scoring the incoming requests in there. 

In such a scenario it is highly inefficient to write the byte buffer received at the remote server on the filesystem and then use Mahout APIs to load the forest.  

We should be able to load the forest from the byte buffer received. This is useful in non-map-reduce usecases of classification like that mentioned above.
