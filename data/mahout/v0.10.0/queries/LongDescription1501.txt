Some guy just decided to make default constructor of org.apache.mahout.clustering.topdown.postprocessor.ClusterOutputPostProcessorDriver private.

This is not really bug, it's just inconsistent since all the other Drivers I found in mahout-core do not have private constructor.

The private constructor inhibits me from doing this:



return ToolRunner.run(new ClusterOutputPostProcessorDriver(), clusterPPArgsStrings);



the very same way I am doing this:



return ToolRunner.run(new KMeansDriver(), kmeansArgsStrings);



Fix would be to just remove private constructor.
