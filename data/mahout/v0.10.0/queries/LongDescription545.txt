The problem is that GSON uses JavaCC which does LL(k) parsing.  The way that the JSON grammar is expressed causes stack recursion for each element of
a vector.

This is evil for parsing large models.

I will be changing ModelSerializer to fix this and will provide a reverse compatible mode for anybody who has been able to serialize/deserialize these models in the past.  My thought is to just make all the SGD models Writables.
