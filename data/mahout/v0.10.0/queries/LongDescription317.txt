The collocation code currently uses maps in the CollocCombiner and CollocReducer to perform frequency calculations which can cause the process to exceed the heap space if a large number of ngrams exist for any given subgram.

Convert the code to use a composite key / secondary sort to avoid the need for in-memory map for frequency calculations.
