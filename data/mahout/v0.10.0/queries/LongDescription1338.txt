mahout-integration contains bits of client and connector code for a lot of projects, like Lucene, Cassandra, MongoDB, etc. As such, its transitive dependencies in Maven pull in quite a lot. 

Most of these are unnecessary for any particular user, since probably at most one client/package is of interest. In fact, mahout-integration is not used by most users at all. 

In the worst case, it causes actual version problems when trying to package up the transitive dependencies of something depending on Mahout.

I suggest several changes along these lines, all of which are represented in the attached patch:

1. Remove direct lucene-core and cassandra-all dependencies, as they are not necessary
2. Mark all dependencies like hector, mongodb, etc as optional in Maven
3. In fact, mark mahout-examples, mahout-buildtools and mahout-integration as optional with respect to the overall project.
4. Bonus: update Cassandra client version to pull in slightly newer deps
