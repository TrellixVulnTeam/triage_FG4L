To complete taste's suite of file-related implementations (currently FileDataModel and FileItemSimilarity) I created an IDMigrator backed by a file. It can be refreshed and will reload it's data into memory in the same way FileDataModel and FileItemSimilarity are already doing this.

I couldn't prevent having to split up the IDMigrator interface into 2 separate interfaces because the update methods (like storeMapping(...) and initialize(...)) did not fit in the concept of reloading data from an external source, hope that's ok.
