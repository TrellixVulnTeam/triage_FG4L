From Vasil on the mailing list:

1. the minLLR parameter is not taken into account. The problem is that in
the CollocDriver class
Job job = new Job(conf);

is executed before

conf.setFloat(LLRReducer.MIN_LLR, minLLRValue);

see CollocDriver.computeNGramsPruneByLLR method

2. maxDFPercent is not taken into account. The problem is that in
TFIDFPartialVectorReducer.reduce the check is

if (df / vectorCount > maxDfPercent) {
         if (log.isInfoEnabled()) {
               log.info("ommiting {}", e.index());
             }
       continue;
     }

and should be:

if (df*100 / vectorCount > maxDfPercent) {
         if (log.isInfoEnabled()) {
               log.info("ommiting {}", e.index());
             }
       continue;
     }
