Adjust the Canopy, MeanShift, K-means, Dirichlet and Fuzzy KMeans implementations to emit ClusterWritables instead of Clusters. Adjust the other clustering tools (ClusterDumper and ClusterEvaluators) to accept ClusterWritables produced by these algorithms.

The new ClusterIterator and ClusterClassifier uses an expanded sequence file representation that stores Clusters as self-describing ClusterWritable objects. So, once all of these algorithms will start emitting ClusterWritables, then KMeans, Dirichlet and FuzzyK will be able to use ClusterIterator and ClusterClassifier for buildClusters phase.
