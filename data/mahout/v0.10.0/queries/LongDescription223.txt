SparseVector:


  @Override
  public boolean haveSharedCells(Vector other) {
    if (other instanceof SparseVector) {
      return other == this;
    } else {
      return other.haveSharedCells(this);
    }
  }



DenseVector:


  @Override
  public boolean haveSharedCells(Vector other) {
    if (other instanceof DenseVector) {
      return other == this;
    } else {
      return other.haveSharedCells(this);
    }
  }



I think the result is self-explanatory.

I'd just check a fix in, but I don't have an svn account yet.  Actually, no I wouldn't because I'm not exactly sure what this method is supposed to do - it's clearly for VectorView instances somehow... but what about Sparse and Dense versions on the same vector (same meaning strictEquivalent() returns true for them)?
