A variation of NearestNUserNeighborhood.  This version adds the minSimilarity parameter, which is the primary factor for including/excluding other users from the target user's neighbourhood.  Additionally, the 'n' parameter was renamed to maxHoodSize and is used to optionally limit the size of the neighbourhood.

The patch is for a brand new class, but we may really want just a single class (either keep this one and axe NearestNUserNeighborhood or add this functionality to NearestNUserNeighborhood), if this sounds good.

I'll update the unit test and provide a patch for that if others think this can go in.

Thoughts?
