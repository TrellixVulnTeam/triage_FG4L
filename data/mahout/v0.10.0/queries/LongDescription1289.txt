When computing similarities with RowSimilarityJob, downsampling highly frequent things is crucial for performance. At the moment, this is done by the data preparation code for collaborative filtering.

We should move the downsampling directly into RowSimilarityJob as we've seen a lot of cases where users want to directly use it.

Furthermore, it should be possible to fix the random seed for the sampling to be able to conduct repeatable experiments.
