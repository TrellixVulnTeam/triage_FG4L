org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.impl.similarity.UncenteredCosineSimilarity only computes the cosine distance between those components of the vectors where both vectors have a value greater zero.

This is inconsistent with the definition of the cosine (correct me if I'm wrong) and is inconsistent with the distributed cosine similarity computation.
