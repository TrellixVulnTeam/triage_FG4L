As discussed previously (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-640) it would be beneficial to provide a persistent storage mechanism for factorizations created by SVDRecommender (in package org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.impl.recommender.svd) as these can be time consuming to produce. It would also allow factorizations to be computed on one machine then distributed to other machines providing predictions, improving efficiency and scalability.

Having a "persistence strategy" interface has been suggested that could be implemented as required. I'll try to post a outline proposal for discussion purposes in the next few days but any comments or suggestions would be very welcome.
