The upcoming clustering needs several capabilities to support different operations.  These include some matrix extensions for adding behaviors to different kinds of matrices.  Also there is a file based matrix that uses mmap to access a file as if it were a matrix in shared memory.  Since this is off-heap and shared between processes, it can seriously help some programs.
