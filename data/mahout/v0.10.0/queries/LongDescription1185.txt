The function processOneUser(long averageCount, long userID) in the MemoryDiffStorage.class file contains a bug for calculating the itemAverage. Since the function tried to calculate the average difference among items (in a nested loop) and also the average individual item preference value in the same loop (the loop only from 0 to length-2, for (int i = 0; i < length - 1; i++)), the itemAverage variable does not count the last item's preference value for every users which could lead to an incorrect recommendation results.
