Implementation of first lemma of Elkan's optimization:
Given three points x, b, c (where b and c are centroids):
                                           d(b,c)>=2d(x.b) then d(x,c)>=d(x,b)
in which case we wouldn't need to calculate d(x,c). This is used to find the closest centroid for every point x.
