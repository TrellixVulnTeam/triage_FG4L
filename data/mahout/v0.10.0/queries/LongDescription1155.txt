There are two changes in this issue:

	making MatrixSlice a Vector by extending DelegatingVector;
	making a few changes to the vector cloning code so that when cloning a Centroid, the result is also a Centroid.



This is part of the changes in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-1154

The Centroid changes will now be part of the larger changes to Vectors:
