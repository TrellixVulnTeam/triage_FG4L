This patch contains an implementation of the Mahalanobis distance + a unit test.
As explained in wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) ,  it is a useful way of determining similarity of an unknown sample set to a known one. It differs from Euclidean distance in that it takes into account the correlations of the data set and is scale-invariant.

Also contained in the patch:
-A port of the SingularValueDecomposition Class to the Matrix data structure + unit tests.
-An embryonic port of the matrix.linalg Algebra class to the Matrix/Vector data structure.
