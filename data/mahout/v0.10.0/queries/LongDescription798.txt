Per http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/c6ea889edb9ad0fe/email_and_collab_filtering, I am working on a variety of examples based on the ASF email archive.  WIP will be at https://github.com/lucidimagination/mahout.

I intend to have at least three examples, one for classification, clustering and collab filtering.
