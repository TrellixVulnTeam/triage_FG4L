This improvement reduces runtime by 80% when performing k-means clustering of Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptors to derive visual words for computer vision.  Unlike sparse document vectors, SIFT descriptors are dense.  This improvement involves updating the org.apache.mahout.clustering.AbstractCluster(Vector point, int id2) constructor to use "point.clone()" instead of "new RandomAccessSparseVector(point)" for creating the centroid.  Also added testKMeansSeqJobDenseVector() test for DenseVector processing.
