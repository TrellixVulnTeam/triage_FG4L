Make a new module, call it mahout-hadoop. Move anything there that is currently in mrlegacy but used in math-scala or spark. Remove dependencies on mrlegacy altogether if possible by using other core classes.

The goal is to have math-scala and spark module depend on math, and a small module called mahout-hadoop (much smaller than mrlegacy).
