Both ItemSimilarityJob and RecommenderJob have to find the overall number of users. This was done with an M/R pass over the data. Instead of that we can use a counter in a previous pass over the data (similar to the way the total number of ngrams if collected in CollocDriver) and thereby save one pass through the data.
