Look at KMeansDriver.isConverged() â€“ we have...

boolean converged = true;
while (converged && ...) {
  converged = converged && ...;
}

converged is never false in the loop so the right side's "converged &&" could be removed.

I'm comparing to KMeansDriver.isConverged() which doesn't use "converged &&" in the while condition and wondering if it's worth a double-check that the logic is in fact different between the two. This came up during some more code inspection.



Also let me tack on this tiny observation:

WeightedDistanceMeasure.configure(): weightsPathName is never null and doesn't need to be checked
