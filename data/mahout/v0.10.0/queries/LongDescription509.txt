Hi all,

As I was going through wikipedia example, I encountered a situation with TrainClassifier wherein some of the options with default values are actually mandatory. 
The documentation / command line help says that 
default source (--datasource) is hdfs but TrainClassifier has withRequired(true) while building the --datasource option. We are checking if the dataSourceType is hbase else set it to hdfs. so ideally withRequired should be set to false
default --classifierType is bayes but withRequired is set to true and we have code like
if ("bayes".equalsIgnoreCase(classifierType)) 
{
        log.info("Training Bayes Classifier");
        trainNaiveBayes(inputPath, outputPath, params);
        
      }
 else if ("cbayes".equalsIgnoreCase(classifierType)) 
{
        log.info("Training Complementary Bayes Classifier");
        // setup the HDFS and copy the files there, then run the trainer
        trainCNaiveBayes(inputPath, outputPath, params);
      }

which should be changed to

if ("cbayes".equalsIgnoreCase(classifierType)) 
{
        log.info("Training Complementary Bayes Classifier");
        trainCNaiveBayes(inputPath, outputPath, params);
        
      }
 else  
{
        log.info("Training  Bayes Classifier");
        // setup the HDFS and copy the files there, then run the trainer
        trainNaiveBayes(inputPath, outputPath, params);
      }

Please let me know if this looks valid and I'll submit a patch for a JIRA issue.
