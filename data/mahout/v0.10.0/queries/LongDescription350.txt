Can add one  "JobName" parameter to org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.hadoop.item.RecommenderJob?
if there's a lot of RecommenderJob,it's hard to distinguish  those jobs.

also RecommenderJob has four sub jobs (or phase ) ,can add sub-job name to those phase ?

Because RecommenderJob has not setNumReduceTasks ,it seems that the performance is not good in reduce phase.
