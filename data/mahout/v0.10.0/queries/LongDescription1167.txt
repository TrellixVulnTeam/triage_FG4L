We need some code for item-based CF usecases with an intermediate data size (e.g., a few million interactions). In such cases, the data might be too big to allow online computation of similarities and recommendations, but at the same time, going to Hadoop might still not be necessary and desired.

In such a case, it makes sense to precompute item similarities on a single machine.
