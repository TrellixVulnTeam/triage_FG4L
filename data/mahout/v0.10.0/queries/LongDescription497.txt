Matrix get and set check the array bounds.  But checking the array bounds calls size.  But size allocates a small integer
array.

This is evil and KILLs performance.

The first fix is to avoid this in SGD based classifiers.  Second will be a real change to the matrix routines to avoid the allocation.
