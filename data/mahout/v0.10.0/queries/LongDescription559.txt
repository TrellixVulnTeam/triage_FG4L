The existing RecommenderEvaluator (AverageAbsoluteDifferenceRecommenderEvaluator.java) has a very limited API. It evaluates a Recommender's performance on a training v.s. test scenario. It does not allow comparing the outputs of different recommenders against the same data model. Also, I could not figure out how its comparison criteria.

OrderBasedRecommenderEvaluator compares the output of two recommenders. It only checks the order of the items in the recommendations, ignoring the returned preference values.
