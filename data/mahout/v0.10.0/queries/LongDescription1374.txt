Currently while running the itembased recommender from the command line, user can get recommendation for a particular set of users by using the userFile option or for particular set of itemId's by using the itemFile option. Using these option together seems to provide recommendations for the cross product for the two inputs. We need an option say userItemFile where a coma separated userid,itemid pair is provide on each line as input and output will be userid,itemid,recommendation. This functionality will be very useful for lot users.
