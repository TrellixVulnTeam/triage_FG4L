Another large changelist constructed from FindBugs and IntelliJ analysis. It's big enough I figured I'd run it by the list. Key changes:


	Making stuff final, private that can be
	Dead code elimination
	Simplifying JUnit assertions – "assertTrue(a.equals(b) == true)" could be "assertEquals(a, b)" for instance. Also fixed some expected/actual value issues
	Not compiling a Pattern object millions of times – String.split() and replace()/replaceAll() do this and can be profitably replaced with a precompiled Pattern.
	Small bug fixes picked up by analysis
