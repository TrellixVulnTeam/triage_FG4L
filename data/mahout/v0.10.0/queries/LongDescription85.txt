Please find attached a first sketch for perceptron and winnow training. Please look very, very carefully at the patch, as I added the heart of the algorithms in the emergency room at Charite Berlin (after I broke my leg when cycling to the Hadoop Get Together  ). 

The patch does not yet feature unit tests nor is it parallelised. Currently my plan is to set up an example with the webKb dataset, add unit tests to the code and after that go parallel. I would like to get some feedback early on, in addition I would feel a lot better, if a second and third pair of eyes had a look at the code to make sure all obvious mistakes are out as early as possible.
