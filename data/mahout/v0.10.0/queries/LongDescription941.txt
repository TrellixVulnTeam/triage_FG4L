This patch adds more statistics to the ConfusionMatrix and RequestAnalyzer.

	Add Kappa measure - a standard measure comparing a sample v.s. random assignment.
	Add mean & standard deviation of "Reliability" (User Accuracy) - assist in identifying consistent mal-assignment against "good" and "bad" labels.
