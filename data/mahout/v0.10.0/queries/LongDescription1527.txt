The examples package has a classification showcase for prediciting the labels of wikipedia  pages. Unfortunately, the example is totally broken:

It relies on the old NB implementation which has been removed, suggests to use the whole wikipedia as input, which will not work well on a single machine and the documentation uses commands that have long been removed from bin/mahout. 

The example needs to be updated to use the current naive bayes implementation and documentation on the website needs to be written.
