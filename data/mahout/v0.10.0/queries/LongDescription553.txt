When using a weighted sum for preference estimation on boolean data, the predicted preferences can only be 1 or NaN which is mathematically correct but not very useful for ranking them. The distributed recommender should therefore adapt the behavior of GenericBooleanPrefItemBasedRecommender in that case: use the sums of similarities to rank the recommended items.
