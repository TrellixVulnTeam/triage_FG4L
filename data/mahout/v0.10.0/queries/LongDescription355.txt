The JavaDoc for org.apache.mahout.fpm.pfpgrowth.fpgrowth.FPGrowth.generateTopKFrequentPatterns(...) states that if the parameter returnableFeatures is null then patterns for every frequent item are generated. 

But this works only if you give the method an empty set, submitting null results in a NullPointerException. Either change the comment or do a null check here.
