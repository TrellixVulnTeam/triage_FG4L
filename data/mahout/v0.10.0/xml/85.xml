            <title>[MAHOUT-85] Perceptron/Winnow Trainer</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-85</link>
                <project id="12310751" key="MAHOUT">Mahout</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Please find attached a first sketch for perceptron and winnow training. Please look very, very carefully at the patch, as I added the heart of the algorithms in the emergency room at Charite Berlin (after I broke my leg when cycling to the Hadoop Get Together &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt; ). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch does not yet feature unit tests nor is it parallelised. Currently my plan is to set up an example with the webKb dataset, add unit tests to the code and after that go parallel. I would like to get some feedback early on, in addition I would feel a lot better, if a second and third pair of eyes had a look at the code to make sure all obvious mistakes are out as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Also - regarding LinearModel ( member: Vector and methods: add (Vector delta) , timesDelta(Vector delta)  ) - can having additional abstraction of a HyperPlane (with Vector as members and addDelta / timesDelta  / distance as methods to it ).  That might be more cleaner , since theoretically we define a LinearModel to be a HyperPlane with a specific DistanceMeasure  and perform classification on the same, and adding / scaling the hyperplane vector is better consolidated separately as opposed to the LinearModel itself. &lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="12786679" author="isabel" created="Sun, 6 Dec 2009 19:41:06 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;It is just a sequential version of the algorithm. No parallelisation and no Hadoop involved.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="12789312" author="isabel" created="Fri, 11 Dec 2009 13:48:11 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I am about to add tests currently. I guess, I will commit once I have those done and go on with a parallel version from there.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12794631" author="isabel" created="Sat, 26 Dec 2009 16:20:22 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The patch has tests added to the implementation. The additional abstraction proposed earlier is integrated. Distance measure is not configurable but corresponds to what was defined in the original algorithm formulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation currently is sequential-only. Still evaluating, if and how is might be possible to parallelize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missing so far: An example showing how to use training, how to store the resulting model and how to apply the model. Probably should be done in a new issue to keep this one focused on the algorithm itself. In addition I still have to at least add links from our wiki to the wikipedia pages on both algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Had some time left during the past few days: Screws in my knee are out now &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/wink.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="12798489" author="gsingers" created="Sun, 10 Jan 2010 14:29:55 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Why is PerceptronTrainingMapper empty?  Are there Driver programs for this?  How do you use the model once it is trained?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12798524" author="isabel" created="Sun, 10 Jan 2010 18:20:02 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;No, sorry. That was me committing a change that I made for &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-240&quot; title=&quot;Parallel version of Perceptron&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;MAHOUT-240&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;MAHOUT-240&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - reverted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far there are no Driver programs yet: This is only the sequential version. The model should be stored after training and loaded at application time. I have deferred implementing an end-to-end example to &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-241&quot; title=&quot;Example for perceptron&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;MAHOUT-241&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;MAHOUT-241&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Currently the implementation only provides for the training logic.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
