                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Shannon reports he suspects a logic error in Eigencuts since it evidently does not produce exactly the expected results. It passes all current unit tests so we need to characterize the results differences and produce a test for it. Marking for 0.5 for now though we will fix it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&apos;s not a logic bug per se, but rather a hack I devised (and obviously forgot about): there&apos;s no explicit calculation done to determine the desiredRank for the eigen-decomposition, and there is no explicit &quot;formula&quot; for this in the original literature, either. This is an item I&apos;ll be asking Dr. Chennubhotla about tomorrow, but needless to say the stopgap measure I implemented during GSoC is nowhere close to scalable: it was to make desiredRank = dimensionality of input data (yes, very bad). We had been discussing the possibility of making this parameter tweak-able by the user (perhaps &quot;suggestable&quot;, kind of along the lines of how Hadoop&apos;s # of M/R tasks can be suggested by the user), but the upshot is this algorithm still needs a reliable way to determine desiredRank in order to function properly.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

argument; like the k in k-means or the -r on SVD?&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="12923711" author="magsol" created="Fri, 22 Oct 2010 01:32:53 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;For the time being, I&apos;m just going to go with a -k type flag for specifying the degree of eigendecomposition. But here are my thoughts on a more permanent solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reading up a little further on the low-rank approximations of the eigencuts paper, it appears that, at least for images, the eigenvalues follow a linear decrease from 1, i.e. each corresponding eigenvalue is &amp;lt;= the previous according to some approximately linear function. In perturbing the flow of probability in the underlying markov transition graph (in order to determine where the clusters are), any eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs that fall under a certain threshold (specified by a combination of epsilon and beta, which are command-line arguments) are ignored. Thus, since the eigenvalues are monotonically decreasing, in theory we&apos;d only need to find which eigenvalue falls beneath the threshold and perform a full decomposition up to that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s an obvious implementation problem there: we can&apos;t really know what that minimum degree is without performing a full decomposition in the first place. Is there a way around this? Do we have an efficient way of calculating, or perhaps approximating, eigenvalues without computing corresponding eigenvectors or otherwise performing a full decomposition? Maybe we could even do this probabilistically by &quot;sampling&quot; from the space of eigenvalues to make a guess on what rank we want? Just throwing ideas out here until the experts respond &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="12982982" author="magsol" created="Tue, 18 Jan 2011 02:02:23 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Attached patch simply adds an argument to the Eigencuts algorithm to specify the desired rank of the eigendecomposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still working with the algorithm&apos;s author to draw up a method of calculating the desired rank. Part of it involves: was the LanczosSolver written to follow an existing implementation of any sort? I.e. is there literature somewhere that specifies how it should be done?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="13032374" author="mleginus" created="Thu, 12 May 2011 13:31:12 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Hi guys,&lt;br/&gt;
I am trying to incorporate the Eigencuts clustering into my thesis and I found one problem within the code (maybe I am wrong &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;). It seems for me that in EigencutsDriver.java on the line 134: &quot;Matrix eigenVectors = new DenseMatrix(overshoot, eigenrank);&quot; should be replaced with Matrix eigenVectors = new DenseMatrix(overshoot, dimensions); as the algorithm trims down the eigenvectors after DistributedLanczosSolver finishes eigenDecomposition. I believe that this part of the code should be identical with the SpectralKmeansDriver and therefore mentioned line should be replaced. I have used Mahout recently and I am just getting familiar with it, therefore its possible that my observation is wrong. If so I am sorry for spamming you. &lt;br/&gt;
Regards &lt;br/&gt;
Martin Leginus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are absolutely correct, in fact. That particular edit was a recent patch to allow the user to specify the eigenrank option (ideally we want to be able to determine this on-the-fly but it&apos;s not there yet), and apparently I goofed on the logic. Good catch, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
