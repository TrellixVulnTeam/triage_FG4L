            <title>[MAHOUT-226] Velocity-based code generation support to support more primitive type collections</title>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We want the complete set of hash maps on the primitive types. The code can be generated. So here&apos;s a code generator to do it, and, to show it off, the TypeTypeFunction.java family set up to be generated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;preformatted panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;preformattedContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; public interface IntDoubleFunction {
 
   /**
    * Applies a function to two arguments.
    *
-   * @param first  first argument passed to the function.
-   * @param second second argument passed to the function.

+   * @param y the second argument passed to the function.
    * @return the result of the function.
    */
-  double apply(int first, double second);
+    int apply(int x, double y);
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the new code conflicts with some previous code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shouldn&apos;t the generated code all be in a separate package.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

However, what you are seeing is that I got it wrong in coding the template. Thanks for the catch.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;When building, mvn complained that the source level on the compiler was not set properly for the collections-codegen-plugin project, but adding a maven-complier-plugin configuration stanza to the pom resolved this problem. The parent pom (maven/pom.xml) should be fixed to add this so that the children are not required to, but I suspect that should be handled as a separate issue, so perhaps for now it could be added to the collections-codegen-plugin pom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Must the template and generated classes retain the cern copyright message?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would we want to generate things &lt;/p&gt;
{type}Object{class} and Object{type}
{class}
&lt;p&gt; (e.g: LongObjectProcedure or ObjectIntProcedure) using this approach as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the plugin approach. I wonder if we should name it something more generic so that it would be a natural location other mahout-specific maven goals could be realized in that submodule, e.g: mahout-maven-plugin with a goal of mahout:generate-collections-sources, for example to build the mahout .job file - but perhaps that&apos;s worth a separate discussion for the dev list, so I would also say this is ok the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12792849" author="bmargulies" created="Sat, 19 Dec 2009 15:03:51 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Drew,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m going to make a patch to make some improvements to the parent POM, next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CXF, we have one Maven module per plugin, but we group them in a subdirectory. However, I think that it is supposedly possible to have multiple mojo classes in a project, so your proposal to rename this one might work. On the other hand, the goal of keeping &apos;math&apos; relatively self-contained might argue for keeping this to itself, or even moving it and math to a subdirectory.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12792850" author="bmargulies" created="Sat, 19 Dec 2009 15:06:37 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Oh, heck. I misread you to have actually checked it in, and I didn&apos;t answer all your questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Legal, it is best to be conservative in retaining CERN copyrights unless we get a grant from CERN. Since I created that template by very light editing of the original, it&apos;s a derived work, and the rule applies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I will be generating the Object guys, but as that involves a larger transition to generics, I didn&apos;t go there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll add another patch file for the compiler plugin.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I&apos;m not a committer, I just review things when I can &amp;#8211; I&apos;ll keep an eye out, I&apos;m stuck in a hotel trying to get a flight out this morning.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="12792857" author="drew.farris" created="Sat, 19 Dec 2009 16:18:23 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;compileroptions.patch looks good too. When it is all said it done it is probably worth wrapping it up into a single final patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears you can use the @goal annotation to setup multiple goals per maven plugin project, but I haven&apos;t done it myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+package org.apache.mahout.math.function;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are already several colt-ish things in that directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My worry is that the code that uses these pre-existing functions is untested and thus we are likely to not notice when something gets bunged by the code generator over-writing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would it be possible to use org.apache.mahout.math.generated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or to relocate all former residents of math.function to math.function.old before generating the code?&lt;/p&gt;
</comment>
                            <comment id="12792880" author="bmargulies" created="Sat, 19 Dec 2009 18:23:28 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;OK, time to turn up the persuasion device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to extend the code from Colt, not to leave it as-is and build next to it.  If you really want to preserve the original colt code unscathed, you should ask me to go back and rework my first commit, since I added several new functions to the IntIntHashMap to provide functionality comparable to Trove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that, ignoring my mistake of last evening, this patch doesn&apos;t change any &apos;functions&apos;. So far, it&apos;s all interfaces. I don&apos;t really see any value in preserving an older copy of the very same interface (as examined at the .class level) under another package name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first really interesting commit in this project would, according to my idea, remove the checked-in AbstractIntIntMap and OpenIntIntHashMap and replace them with templates, and thus get the complete set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s why I started with unit tests for that stack of code, so that I could prove to everyone, including myself, that I don&apos;t bust the IntInt map when adding all the others via the template trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SInce I can&apos;t imagine any way to unit test an interface, let alone an interface consisting of a single function that takes two parameters and returns a boolean, I didn&apos;t write specific a specific unit test for IntIntProcedure. But there are uses of that interface and implementations of it in the unit tests I wrote for the int-int map. So, I think I could claim with some justification that there are now tests that would catch bad things on these items. Not so for the &apos;Function&apos; thing that I mistakenly put in the initial patch, and which I have no intention of touching at all, ever, as part of the hash table extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pattern I&apos;m proposing here is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) create adequate unit tests&lt;br/&gt;
2) enhance&lt;br/&gt;
3) rinse, lather, repeat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m claiming that I&apos;ve got tests for the IntInt hash map, and so I can tackle it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next will come the Object-* case, which will need tests before I change anything, and then the *-Object case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should have as a secondary goal keeping this Colt-derived module as general as makes sense for us, to maximize reusability on its own. But this change seems fine in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Benson,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am completely down with you modifying rather than building beside Colt.  I also understand the difficulty of testing interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I was suggesting was possible ways to avoid silent errors.  Putting generated code in one place and then removing references to the Colt code would be a path that would avoid some of the risk that I am seeing with the current approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, hey, you are doing the work.  That gives you the biggest vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s an interesting thing. I do use your your technique &apos;internally&apos;, but, at least this time around, the scaffolding was removed before I got to the point posting a patch. I have considered moving all the &apos;to be replaced&apos; code to a separate directory which can be incorporated with the build-helper-plugin (or not) to allow comparing things.&lt;/p&gt;
