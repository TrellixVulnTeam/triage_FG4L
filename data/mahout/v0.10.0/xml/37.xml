            <title>[MAHOUT-37] Tarball for Mahout-ified Taste code</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-37</link>
                <project id="12310751" key="MAHOUT">Mahout</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;I will attach to this issue a tarball containing my proposed contribution of the Taste project to Mahout. I think it&apos;s been scrubbed, repackaged, reformatted, cleaned up, and generally prepared for easy integration into Mahout. In particular I made many optional dependencies truly optional, so the core distro is quite lean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MD5 hash of the tarball is db78114f9799905c7d4a5a1907a03e6f&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MD5 hash of the tarball is db78114f9799905c7d4a5a1907a03e6f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sean, can you specify what tool and version was used to generate the MD5 hash?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

It doesn&apos;t report a version but ssh reports it&apos;s using OpenSSL 0.9.7l if that helps. Uh oh is it not matching? I could try on another machine.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Do you have the license for the EJB file?  I think that just needs to go in the lib there too.  Before a Mahout release, we will need to put together a NOTICES.txt, but we don&apos;t need that yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think that license is a showstopper at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12593566" author="srowen" created="Thu, 1 May 2008 17:28:24 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/license/ejb-2_1-fr-spec-license.html&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/license/ejb-2_1-fr-spec-license.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... is the license I could find for the EJB 2.1 spec. IANAL so can&apos;t be sure that I understand if there are any complications in these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a layman, I am all but certain redistributing these API classes (this is all interface/spec, no implementation) is OK.  I note that Tomcat redistributes the servlet and JSP API classes freely. I don&apos;t see additional license materials included in that distro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&apos;s concern about it... it&apos;s possible to separate out this code easily, and just toss it (not sure anyone is using EJBs anymore, really?) or put it in contrib with the proviso that it only compiles if you go find the EJB classes, but I suppose I would be surprised if that is deemed necessary, because then doesn&apos;t Tomcat have a problem? I am not sure if the fact that it itself implements those specs makes a difference, or whether there is some blanket agreement between Apache and Sun on this point, and whether it extends past Tomcat or what.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12593598" author="gsingers" created="Thu, 1 May 2008 19:09:56 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;I think we just need to figure it out by the time we release.  I&apos;m  &lt;br/&gt;
guessing it is ok, since it is just the API and I would think they  &lt;br/&gt;
would want to encourage adoption.  Besides, the container provides the  &lt;br/&gt;
implementation, right?  I personally don&apos;t have any interest in EJB,  &lt;br/&gt;
but others might, so I don&apos;t care it stays or goes.&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="12593631" author="srowen" created="Thu, 1 May 2008 21:45:57 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s right, this is just the API, so I can compile an EJB against the interfaces, so it can be run in a container that provides the implementation. The .jar here is purely the interfaces that are part of the public spec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant you may know better than I whom to ask within Apache. I would hold up Tomcat as an example of an Apache project redistributing Sun&apos;s J2EE API .jars, and see if whatever reasoning or agreement covered that covers us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is any pushback, I am not too upset about removing the EJB API. It&apos;s EJB 2.x, versus EJB 3.x, and I am not clear if anyone uses it. It&apos;d be shame to remove perfectly working code over licensing issues that likely aren&apos;t issues, but not a big shame.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12594544" author="gsingers" created="Tue, 6 May 2008 11:49:48 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;OK, looks like we are good to go!  Whew.  See &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/200805.mbox/ajax/%3c9EBB5BAC-BAA9-4486-BBAF-FB071F075669@apache.org%3e&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/200805.mbox/ajax/%3c9EBB5BAC-BAA9-4486-BBAF-FB071F075669@apache.org%3e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sean, I think you mentioned you have some initial parallelizations of Taste, so I guess I would suggest you just put them up as a patch either on this issue or a new issue and then we can commit them and start digging in deeper.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12594612" author="srowen" created="Tue, 6 May 2008 17:00:50 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Rock n roll. Yes, I have some stuff in bits and pieces over here. Once the code is committed, I&apos;ll integrate it properly and refine it and post as a new issue / patch.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12595468" author="srowen" created="Fri, 9 May 2008 06:04:20 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Sorry, all y&apos;all waiting on me to commit the tarball? happy to, just wondering if someone more experienced would like to take a look and put the pieces in the right places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I suppose there aren&apos;t that many questions. The main one is that I have my own build.xml file and build.properties file. I can integrate them into the main one, or leave it as a separate build file. Either works fine; I like more integration, though I have a lot of targets. I can rename them as &quot;taste-build&quot; etc. and hook them in to common &quot;build&quot; targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lib/ directory maps onto the existing one, as does my src/main and src/test dir. I have a src/examples &amp;#8211; could I make a new root for that?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12595567" author="gsingers" created="Fri, 9 May 2008 12:32:57 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;I think you can go ahead and do it, I&apos;m pretty swamped for the next  &lt;br/&gt;
week plus.  As for builds, etc.  I think ideally it&apos;s all just  &lt;br/&gt;
integrated in under core and uses that build.  I think there is an  &lt;br/&gt;
examples section under core/src (or somewhere like that).  I wonder if  &lt;br/&gt;
this will be the time that people want separate jars or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think once this is in and naive bayes is in, we should start  &lt;br/&gt;
thinking about releasing 0.1.&lt;/p&gt;

I will follow up with a general e-mail to the list about some additional work that needs to be done to complete the integration, but, it&apos;s all in there and compiles and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
