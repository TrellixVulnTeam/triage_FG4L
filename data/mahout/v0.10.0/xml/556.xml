It is possible to restrict the fields that are returned in this document by specifying the 'field' parameter in your request.
For example, to request only the issue key and summary add field=key&field=summary to the URL of your request.

&lt;p&gt;Bug related to creation of the model when you run trainlogistic &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Its creating the JSON model file  using the toJson function as illustrated below&lt;br/&gt;
--------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;
In,&lt;br/&gt;
 LogisticModelParameters.java&lt;br/&gt;
Function&lt;br/&gt;
void saveTo(Writer out)&lt;/p&gt;
{
...
..
String savedForm = gson.toJson(this);
...
}
&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not working as expected : -  String savedForm = gson.toJson(this);&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For my experiment using a different dataset - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get the following model file : &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;{&quot;targetVariable&quot;:&quot;customer&quot;,&quot;typeMap&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
{&quot;feature2&quot;:&quot;n&quot;,&quot;feature3&quot;:&quot;n&quot;,
    &quot;feature1&quot;:&quot;n&quot;}
&lt;p&gt;,&quot;numFeatures&quot;:334,&quot;useBias&quot;:true,&quot;maxTargetCategories&quot;:&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;,&lt;br/&gt;
    &quot;numCategories&quot;:2,&quot;step&quot;:260951,&quot;updateSteps&quot;:{}&quot;updateCounts&quot;:{}&lt;br/&gt;
    &quot;lambda&quot;:1.0E-4,&quot;prior&quot;:{}&quot;sealed&quot;:true,&quot;gradient&quot;:{}}}&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you notice the last part,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  &quot;numCategories&quot;:2,&quot;step&quot;:260951,&quot;updateSteps&quot;:{}&quot;updateCounts&quot;:{}&lt;br/&gt;
    &quot;lambda&quot;:1.0E-4,&quot;prior&quot;:{}&quot;sealed&quot;:true,&quot;gradient&quot;:{}}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;are missing commas between updateSteps,updateCounts  and Sealed variables&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigating further, &lt;br/&gt;
These come from the  AbstractOnlineLogisticRegression.java and the above variables are not initialized hence the wrong output by the toJson function. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a bug with  - &amp;gt; gson.toJson function,  I see that I am using gson-1.3 and upgrading to 1.4  by modifying core/pom.xml fixes things, But runLogistic then complains about &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10/11/29 03:29:43 WARN conf.Configuration: DEPRECATED: hadoop-site.xml found in the classpath. Usage of hadoop-site.xml is deprecated.

&lt;p&gt;THanks for looking into this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started building up serializers of the entire sgd framework using serializers because large models just aren&apos;t feasible to serialize&lt;br/&gt;
using JSON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me check the state of those changes.  Last I looked, I think that they were very close to ready.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12964775" author="tdunning" created="Mon, 29 Nov 2010 15:22:41 +0000"  >
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-545&quot; title=&quot;GSON not a good fit for deserializing SGD models&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;MAHOUT-545&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;MAHOUT-545&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the issue I have been using to track JSON serialization problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with missing comma&apos;s shouldn&apos;t be occurring if ModelSerializer is used.  The RunLogistic&lt;br/&gt;
code is kind of old so it may not be using that class.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12964776" author="tdunning" created="Mon, 29 Nov 2010 15:25:33 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Yes.  I think that this code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;
    GsonBuilder gb = &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; GsonBuilder();
    gb.registerTypeAdapter(Matrix.class, &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; MatrixTypeAdapter());
    Gson gson = gb.setPrettyPrinting().create();
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in LogisticModelParameters.saveTo() at about line 126 should actually be more like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;
    Gson gson = ModelSerializer.gson();
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The serializer that results has lots of adapters installed already.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12965089" author="rohananil" created="Tue, 30 Nov 2010 04:45:23 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks! That works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same edit is needed in the  LogisticModelParameters.loadFrom!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another bug: in Auc.java&lt;br/&gt;
Classifier Evaluation : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when the scores are tied -  &lt;br/&gt;
...&lt;br/&gt;
        // how many negatives are tied?&lt;br/&gt;
        int k0 = 0;&lt;br/&gt;
        while (i0 &amp;lt; n0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; v0 == tieScore) &lt;/p&gt;
{
          k0++;
          i0++;
          v0 = scores[0].get(i0);
        }

&lt;p&gt;        // and how many positives&lt;br/&gt;
        int k1 = 0;&lt;br/&gt;
        while (i1 &amp;lt; n1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; v1 == tieScore) &lt;/p&gt;
{
          k1++;
          i1++;
          v1 = scores[1].get(i1);
        }
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sometimes goes Index out of bounds: Increment operation should be after accessing it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; while (i0 &amp;lt; n0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; v0 == tieScore) &lt;/p&gt;
{
          v0 = scores[0].get(i0);
          k0++;
          i0++;
         
        }

&lt;p&gt;        // and how many positives&lt;br/&gt;
        int k1 = 0;&lt;br/&gt;
        while (i1 &amp;lt; n1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; v1 == tieScore) &lt;/p&gt;
{
          v1 = scores[1].get(i1);
          k1++;
          i1++;

&lt;p&gt;Rohan I&apos;d also open brand-new issue for unrelated issues, instead of commenting on an unrelated one. The second issue you mention, however, seems to have already been fixed anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
