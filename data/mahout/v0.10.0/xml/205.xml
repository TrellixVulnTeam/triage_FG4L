            <title>[MAHOUT-205] Pull Writable (and anything else hadoop dependent) out of the matrix module</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-205</link>
                <project id="12310751" key="MAHOUT">Mahout</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Vector and Matrix extend Writable, and while that was merely poorly coupled before, it will be an actual problem now that we have a separate submodule for matrix: this module should not depend on hadoop at all, ideally.   Distributed matrix work, as well as simply Writable wrappers can go somewhere else (where?  core?  yet another submodule which depends on matrix?), but it would be really nice if we could produce an artifact which doesn&apos;t require Hadoop which has our core linear primitives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="12796941" author="jake.mannix" created="Wed, 6 Jan 2010 01:26:29 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Monster monster patch.  So many diffs, yikes.  mvn clean install passes on my laptop, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&apos;t tried to actually remove all hadoop dependencies in the maven world in this patch, I&apos;ve just ripped Writable off of Vector and Matrix, which was a big enough undertaking, given the number of places that required not-IDE-based refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d welcome any code review eyeballs on this, for things done which are obviously horrible.  I may need to go put back in some tests, because I had to rip out a few IO-related tests and I may have forgotten to put all of them back.  &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12797014" author="jake.mannix" created="Wed, 6 Jan 2010 06:59:36 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Ok, this new patch actually removes the hadoop dependency in mahout-math.  All tests pass, but because tests had to be refactored a bit, I&apos;m not 100% sure I&apos;ve got exactly the coverage that was there before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll leave it up here for a bit, but I&apos;m going to want to commit this pretty soon, because this patch and the one for &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-206&quot; title=&quot;Separate and clearly label different SparseVector implementations&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;MAHOUT-206&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;MAHOUT-206&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are pretty conflictory.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12797016" author="jake.mannix" created="Wed, 6 Jan 2010 07:05:27 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;It should be noted: the place the dependency went to is just mahout-core (where it was already).  Serialization stuff seemed to belong in utils, but we have our dependencies running the other way, so that&apos;s a no-go.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12797111" author="srowen" created="Wed, 6 Jan 2010 13:31:12 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Now, it may still be my environment, since I was still seeing compile problems. I completely reset my installation. After this patch I get errors like...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/Users/srowen/Documents/Development/Mahout/core/src/main/java/org/apache/mahout/math/VectorWritable.java:&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;42,34&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; cannot find symbol&lt;br/&gt;
symbol  : constructor DenseVector(org.apache.mahout.math.Vector)&lt;br/&gt;
location: class org.apache.mahout.math.DenseVector&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/Users/srowen/Documents/Development/Mahout/core/src/main/java/org/apache/mahout/math/DenseMatrixWritable.java:&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;30,17&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; cannot find symbol&lt;br/&gt;
symbol  : method rowSize()&lt;br/&gt;
location: class org.apache.mahout.math.DenseMatrixWritable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this make any sense?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12797180" author="jake.mannix" created="Wed, 6 Jan 2010 17:08:18 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Are you getting those during mvn clean install, or in your IDE, or where?  I remember seeing Idea forget that even though VectorWritable and DenseMatrixWritable were in o.a.m.math, since they were in the mahout-core module, not mahout-math, that it ended up confused.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m running the tests in the background on a clean checkout (you&apos;re using the newer of the two patches, right?), and no compile problems here (although I didn&apos;t blow away all of my .m2 folder... I guess I can try that next...) - Mac OS X, fwiw.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12797192" author="jake.mannix" created="Wed, 6 Jan 2010 17:33:36 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Ok, blew away ~/.m2, clean checkout with the later patch applied, and &quot;mvn clean compile&quot; ends with BUILD SUCCESSFUL (after 17m 9s, oof!).  Anyone else try this patch to see if you see what Sean saw?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12797221" author="drew.farris" created="Wed, 6 Jan 2010 18:18:38 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Works for me, with a clean checkout &amp;amp; latest patch applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that build does a long time indeed. (for me: 12m6s) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FWIW, here are some of the worst performing unit tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running org.apache.mahout.clustering.dirichlet.TestMapReduce&lt;br/&gt;
Tests run: 16, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 164.514 sec&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running org.apache.mahout.clustering.kmeans.TestKmeansClustering&lt;br/&gt;
Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 56.446 sec&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running org.apache.mahout.clustering.fuzzykmeans.TestFuzzyKmeansClustering&lt;br/&gt;
Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 58.853 sec&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Seems like it would be reasonable to open another issue the remind one of us to look more closely at these)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I know I had problems with the patch but hope someone else didn&apos;t. If not, is it still suitable for committing? I can try again.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12799293" author="jakemannix" created="Tue, 12 Jan 2010 17:57:00 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not byet committed, because I was hoping at least one other person besides Drew could verify it builds properly... the patch might be a tiny bit out of date now, I&apos;ll check in a bit when I get to work.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12799636" author="jake.mannix" created="Wed, 13 Jan 2010 07:31:02 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;up to date patch, with Robin&apos;s most recent Vectorizer commits merged in.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
