Move focus back to jEditactual behavior:jEdit freezes for multiple seconds as the app checks file status for each buffer.expected behavior:Buffer should be editable immediately.The patch adds a combo box to GlobalOptionPane that controls when jEdit checks file status.

This option could be dropped if those goals aren't important.--- 2The 'application focus, visiting[...]' option is useful in an environment where multiple users may edit a file simultaneously.--- 3The 'visiting the buffer or saving any buffer' option defers notification of file changes until the user is at a natural pausing point in workflow.--- 4The 'visiting or saving the buffer' option deals well with many files where checking file attributes has high latency, such as in the sshfs-attached filesystem scenario that motivated this patch.--- 5The 'saving the buffer' option disables checking file attributes except during save and exit.

This is not user friendly, since users do not normally know what each token type means for the specific mode(s) they're using. For example, if I want to configure the style of C++ variables, I need to match the style of a variable in some C++ buffer against the various token types in the option pane. If there are multiple token types with the same style, I need to try each one, click 'apply' and check how it affects the coloring in the buffer until I find which token type corresponds to C++ variables.I think the following would make it much easier for users to customize the styles: Provide an action that finds the token type under the caret, and opens the syntax style dialog for that token type. This way, the user doesn't even need to know the token types, he can simply put the caret on a variable, invoke the action and configure the style for variables.Later, this mechanism can be extended to provide mode-specific colors (i.e. override the global settings, like with the Editing option pane) - the style dialog can have a check-box to specify whether to set the global or mode-specific style for the token type, and jEdit can override the global settings with mode-specific ones whenever the mode is changed.

Hence, it did not recalculate the fold levels of the preceding lines, and did not update the fold markers accordingly. The patch for the indent folding mode gives whitespace-only lines the same fold level as the first non-whitespace-only line following them, so it breaks this assumption, since a change to a line can affect the fold level of preceding whitespace-only lines. This commit fixes the assumption by adding a new method to the fold handler for returning the fold levels of preceding lines. Whenever the fold level of a line is changed, this new method is called and the fold levels of the preceding lines get updated correctly. By default, this method does not return anything so no overhead (almost) is added. | Applied a modified version of patch #2846169: IndentFoldHandler - allow blank lines after start of fold. The change is to try to take the fold level of whitespace-only lines from the next non-whitespace line, so that empty lines at the beginning of a fold are considered part of the fold.The modification from the patch is that the recursion has been replaced with an iterator.",shlomy,shlomy,patch
2882702,10/22/2009,Multiple Monitor Right Click Context Menu Issue,"Details: google_ad_section_start When operating with multiple monitors, the right click context menu always displays to the left of the arrow on the secondary monitor. It appears that when the jedit window is in the second monitor (to the right in my case) jedit always believes it is approaching the right most margin of the observable area and pushes the menu to the left to keep it visible. Even though in my case this area is still visible.This occurs with jEdit 4.3pre17 on both Windows and Linux. google_ad_section_end","daleanson,elberry,lukerlt,shlomy,ezust,dlr365","1,1,3,4,2,1",shlomy,shlomy,shlomy,shlomy,16406,"Fixed bug #2882702: Multiple Monitor Right Click Context Menu Issue The context menu in the text area did not take into account multi-screen environments, and used the local graphics environment's maximum screen bounds, which returns the bounds of a single graphics device.",shlomy,shlomy,bug
