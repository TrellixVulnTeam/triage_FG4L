1,1/13/2008,SFTP transfers cause memory leaks under Mac OS X 10.4 and Java 1.5,"Under Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), transferring files from and/or to an SFTP server causes the JVM to leak memory fast, leaking approximately the same amount of memory as the data transferred.

66,8/3/2008,--no-splash should be a checkbox in the Preferences dialogue,"Hi.I have nothing agaist the design of the splash screen. It's neat. But splash screens annoy me in general: they hover on top of the window you want to work in just to show that, yes, the program whose symbol you just clicked, does indeed start up. And I have found that often the splash screens slow down start-up. With muCommander my impression is that start-up is almost twice as fast without splash, even on a dual-core AMD (2 GHz) with 2 Gigs of RAM. Now, I found the forum post that told me to add the --no-splash as a start-up parameter. On Linux, you have to be root to do that (considering muCommander has been installed systemwide by root; the startup script is in /usr/share/mucommander/). Hmmm.Also, for Windows, I will have to check on Monday and edit the respective setting. Not really userfriendly towards the average GUI user. If possible, it would be great if you could add a ""[ ] show splash screen at start-up"" checkbox somewhere in the Preferences dialogue (by the way: German translation may be: ""[ ] zeige Startbild"" -- even better (and simpler) would be a check box ON the start-up screen ""[ ] don't show this again"" ...Best regardsAndreas","maxence@…,sclebo05@…","1,3",nicolas,nicolas.rinaudo,maxence,maxence.bernard,2764,"Commit on behalf of Joshua Lebo: added 'Show splash screen' preference, replacing CLI options (bug #66).",maxence,maxence.bernard,defect

Actual behavior :- One of the parent folders (usually /pub) cannot be expanded - the spinning dial icon spins endlessly (see attached screenshot). Additional information: - The debug output indicates that the folder failed to be listed (exception in FTPFile.ls()) because of the following FTP server error ""530 Sorry, the maximum number of clients (3) from your host are already connected."". This means that 3 concurrent threads were already accessing the FTP server (each with its own connection) when the ls() attempt was made. -The bug can be reproduced most of the time but not always.

The folder icon should probably be changed to one that symbolizes the failure: CustomFileIconProvider?.NOT_ACCESSIBLE_FILE might be a good fit. 2) It seems that the tree spawns 4 threads (or more).
