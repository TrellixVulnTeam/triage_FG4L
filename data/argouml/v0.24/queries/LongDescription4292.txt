When editing an argument from a method I miss the ability to move up/down the 
list of arguments for a method. I now have to move up to the owning method, 
then select the next argument. A similar feature can be used when editing 
classes->properties and classes->fields, enumeration->items e.g.

Notice that a similar feature already exists. When editing a association, there 
is a feature (button "|-" that allows you to switch between both ends).
