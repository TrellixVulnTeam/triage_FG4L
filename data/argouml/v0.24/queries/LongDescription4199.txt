ArgoUML should use the correct TaggedValue notation as described in the standard
in the explorer.

I found this in the stereotype declaration notation chapter:

Individual items (tags) in the list are defined according to the following format:
   tagDefinitionName : String [multiplicity]
where string can be either a string matching the name of a data type
representing the type of the values of the tag, or it is a reference to a
metaclass or a stereotype. In the latter case, the string has the form:
   «metaclass» metaclassName
or
   «stereotype» stereotypeName
where metaclassName is the name of the referenced metaclass and is the name of
the references stereotype. The multiplicity element is optional and conforms to
standard rules for specifying multiplicities. In case of a range specification,
a lower bound of zero indicates an optional tag.


BTW: Currently, a taggedvalue is shown with:
    name = ("1-" + tagName);
in the DisplayTextTree.convertValueToText().

Anybody has any idea why the "1-" ?

BTW2: Make the taggedvalue visible in the explorer by selecting the
Composite-centric explorer view.
