Adjust grid and Adjust Grid Snap should be via dialog boxes (only one 
needed
really).

Adjust Grid Snap gives spacings of 4, 8, 16, 32 in a cycle. However if
you 
take an item to a boundary that is a multiple of 4, but not 8 (e.g. 28) and
then set a grid snap 
spacing of 8, it will snap to sapcing of 28, 36, 44 etc,
not to the boundaries of multiples of 8 (24, 
32, 40 etc).
