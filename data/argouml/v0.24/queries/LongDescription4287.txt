Bob: "We used to use the standard java way of detecting locale. Checking system
properties etc. As far as I'm aware this used to work.

I believe the preferences were added becaus eoccasionally a user wanted to
override the settings of their PC.

I think there should be a "default" option in the language combo of the
settings->appearance tab. If this is selected then we should use our old
mechanism to determine locale."



AFAIK, Argo checks for a chosen language in the preference file.. if present, it
is loaded and set as the default locale. Before of this, 

IMHO, we should also try to load dinamically the available i18n.. currently,
they're hardcoded.
