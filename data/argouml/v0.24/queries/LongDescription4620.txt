Create a new statechart diagram with two SimpleState and a Transition between
both. Add a Guard to the Transition. (screenshot1)
Save your project. In the XMI, the attribute body and language are not empty.
<UML:BooleanExpression xmi.id =
'127-0-0-1--6214e0d:1107dfcfb50:-8000:000000000000078F'                  
language = 'lang' body = 'expr'/>

Open your saved project and go to the Guard, the field language is empty.
(screenshot 2)

I've tested three cases :
If you edit the language field and save the project, the body attribute will be
empty in the XMI file. The language attribute is correct.
If you edit the body field and save the project, the language attribute will be
empty in the XMI file. The body attribute is correct.
If you edit both fields, the attributes body and language in the XMI will be
correct.
