Classes with the same name but different owning packages are not handled well
(whether this is a good practice or not is another issue).

Try to create two packages (e.g. pack1, pack2), then put two classes with the
same name in each of the two pacakges (e.g. pack1/MyClass, pack2/MyClass).
Create a third class, then create an attribute.
Suppose you want to make the attribute of type pack2/MyClass: there's only one
MyClass in the drop down list in the property panel, and there's no way to know
which one of the two.
This is true for parameters too.
