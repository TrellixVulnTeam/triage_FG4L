Add buttons for trigger, guard and effect on the properties panel of a transition.

This is the original remark from Jose Gonzalez Gomez that prompted me to write
this issue:


"Hi there,
I'm trying to set the guard in a transition in a state diagram, but I don't know
how to set it. I've found a mail in the archives telling that if you set the
description of the transition to a text of the form "trigger [guard]/effect" the
text gets parsed and the attributes of the transition get filled, but I don't
know where to write such a text (I've tried in the Name field with no success).
Any ideas (using v0.20)?"

and his own reply:

"I just discovered it: you may select the desired transition and start typing,
or you may right-click on Trigger, Guard or Effect to get a contextual menu
where you can create a new trigger, guard or event. (I find the later not that
much intuitive, so maybe a button could be included to make this more explicit?) "

Compared to creating an operation for a class: There are 2 toolbuttons for this,
one on the diagram toolbar, and one on the proppanel, but no popup menu.
We should follow this design for trigger/guard/effect.
