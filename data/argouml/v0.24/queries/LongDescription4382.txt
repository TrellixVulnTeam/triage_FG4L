Text entered into the Object Flow box of Activity Diagrams disappear 
immediately - (or after saving and reopening the model, the latest)

The box seems to have two text fields but none keeps its values.

Other items in the Activity Diagram such as Action States are fine though.

I discovered the issue in version 0.21 but it is still in the latest 
0.22BETA2.
