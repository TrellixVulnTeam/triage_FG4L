The click-spot on the diagram for e.g. a transition or association is difficult 
to find, when no text is shown yet.

E.g. create a new association or transition, then double-click to start editing 
text.
This is especially difficult in case of a vertical edge.

Workaround is to select the edge, and just start typing (but that does not work 
all the time - food for another issue).

I see 2 ways to solve this:
1. We can increase the minimum size. Maybe as simple as adding some spaces to 
the empty text.
2. Or show boxes around text-figs for a selected element? Better then boxes: 
Make the text-area x% darker (when selected).

I keep this issue as DEFECT, since I vaguely seem to recall that the situation 
used to be better in previous versions of ArgoUML.
