In current CVS

1. Place 2 classes with a generalization between.
2. Attach a comment to the generalization.
3. Save the project then load it.
4. Move the comment.

The comment edge attached the the generalization leaps to position (0,0)
detaching from the generalization.

The situation is easily repaired by manipulating the generalization ,the comment
edge leaps back to the correct place and behaves correctly from that point forward.
