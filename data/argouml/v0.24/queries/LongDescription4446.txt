The value for attribute "Reference State" for StubState objects is wrongly handled.

Scenario:
1. create a state machine M1 (not empty)
2. create a second state machine M2
3. define a SubmachineState in M2 with a StubState that refers to a state in M1
4. click outside the StubState (to deselect it)
5. click on the StubStateAgain, the referenced state name disappear from the diagram
6. click outside the StubState (to deselect it) again the StubState looses the
value for the attribute "Reference State"
