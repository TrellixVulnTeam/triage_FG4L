Keyboard navigation: Radio buttons

1. Radio buttons in the details pane should all be clearly grouped, and 
preferrably surrounded by a border. This because of the special 
navigation with the keyboard between the buttons. Currently, some are, 
some are not. See e.g. Visibility for an operation, and visibility for an 
attribute.
2. Pressing the Tab key to cycle through all interface components, 
should land the focus on the selected radio button only, not all in turn 
individually. Pressing Tab again should lead the focus from the group to 
the next component. This rule is in the Java design guidelines, and apply 
for Windows, too. But I can find a lot of examples where even Sun and 
Microsoft sin against this rule: see e.g. Outlook Express V6.0, Tools-
>Options...->Send: There are 2 groups of 2 radio buttons, the first of 
which follows the rule, the second not.
Conclusion: this rule is not that important.
3. Once the focus is on one of the radio buttons, the 4 arrow keys 
should allow selecting a different one.
