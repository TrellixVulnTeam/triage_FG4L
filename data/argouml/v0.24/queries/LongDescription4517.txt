1. create a new project
2. create two classes A and B
3. connect the two classes with an association
4. change to one of the association ends and give it a name
5. try to activate the "unchangeable" radio button in the group "changeability"
   => The "unchangeable" radio button will be selected but not activated
6. try to activate the "unchangeable" radio button again
   => this time it will work
7. select any other model element, then return to the particular association end
   => the radio in group "changeability" will be back on "changeable"

Nevertheless, when the project is saved and one takes a peek into the XMI file
in the .zargo file the value "frozen" has somehow made it into there. But this
way you never really know about the real changeability state of the association end.
