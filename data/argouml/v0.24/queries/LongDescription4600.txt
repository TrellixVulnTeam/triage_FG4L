Issue 4599 the project loaded in ArgoUML with no error report appearing to the
user. However the error was in the log.

The exception was caught in the OpenException catch block in
ProjectBrowser.loadProject. This calls reportError but it seems that report
error does nothing if the ProgressMonitor is available.

The error I had can be simulated by throwing a NullPointerException in the last
line of FigEdgeModelElement.makeEdgePort
