If I import Java source code then I see the Java source code in the Source tab
of the class.  This makes me believe I can edit the source.  When I change the
source, click on another entity and click back the change is lost.  Same for
when I modify "UML 1.3" source.

If I am not allowed to modify source then the background of the text should
indicate that.  Normally indicated by the background color set to form
background.  It is still okay to allow highlighting and copying but no edits
should be allowed.

Note: I entered this as a defect because you are allowed to modify the text but
it does not save the changes.
