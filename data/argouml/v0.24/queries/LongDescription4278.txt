Not sure if this has to do with UML spec, or if it's truly a defect, but here goes...  

Create a use case "A", and associate an Actor with it.  Then create a use case "B", and create an "Extends" 
relationship so that B extends A.  The critic comes up and says "Add Associations to B".  

1.  Does the "Extends" relationship not count as an association?
2.  Or, alternatively, if "B" extends "A", and the actor is associated with "A", is the actor implicitly 
associated with "B" as well?
