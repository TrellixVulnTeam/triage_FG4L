Zoom slider operations problems	

Problem 1.
1. Open the slider (The knob has the focus, it is blue).
2. Set the zoom-factor to 0% (e.g. by pressing the End key). 
3. Press the arrow down key.
This should set the percentage to 1%, which it does, but first it hangs 
ArgoUML for a while (ca. 2 minutes).
The same problem can be reproduced with the mouse.

Problem 2.
1. Open the slider (The knob has the focus, it is blue).
2. Press the Home or End key. 
The expected direction is wrong; Home leads to the maximum percentage, End to 
0%.

Problem 3.
1. Open the slider (The knob has the focus, it is blue).
2. Press the Left or Right arrow key. 
The expected direction is wrong; Left increases with 1%, Right decreases.
One solution would be to disable these keys.
