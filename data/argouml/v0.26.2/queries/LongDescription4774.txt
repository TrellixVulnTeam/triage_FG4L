The ordering of attributes, association ends, operations, owned elements in a
class can be altered with a 'move up' and 'move down'.

Please implement a 'move to top' and 'move to bottom', this will allow for much
faster ordering.

Please also implement key bindings for doing the above four mentioned
operations. Perhaps some meta key with up, down, home and end keys when the list
to be sorted has been selected or has focus.
