Due to the usage of the flag XmiWriterMDRImpl.WRITE_ALL in
XmiWriterMDRImpl.write(), it isn't possible to save models loaded as profiles.
This prevents using a functionality implemented in
ProfileConfigurationFilePersister which would persist user defined profiles in
the *.zargo files, so that it would be possible to open these files even if the
user defined profiles upon which they depend aren't available in the user's
configured profile directories.

The issue seams to be deeper than simply removing WRITE_ALL, since, when I
experimentally removed it, it still wasn't writing the profile model. Only an
empty XMI was written.

I won't be able to tackle this before the release, so creating it unassigned...
