Selected tab is remembered per fig

Create a class and a package on a class-diagram.

1. First the part that works OK:

Select the package by clicking on it in the diagram.
Click the style tab in the details pane.
Select the class by clicking on it in the diagram.
Click the properties tab in the details pane.
Click on the package. The properties tab is still selected.

2. Now the part that is inconsistent with the situation above, and not 
OK:

Select the class by clicking on it in the diagram.
Click the style tab in the details pane.
Select the package by clicking on it in the diagram.
Click the properties tab in the details pane.
Click on the class. Why is now the style tab selected again? I would 
expect the tab selection to remain.
