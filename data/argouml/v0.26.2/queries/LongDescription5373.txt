After downloading and unpacking the zip version of ArgoUML 0.26beta1, I unpacked it into
a directory and started it by double clicking argouml.jar.  I created a single class and
then selected Generate All Classes.  When the code generation dialog came up, the default
output directory was 

C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\Thomas.Neustupny\Desktop

which I'm pretty sure isn't a directory that I ever used on my system.  Not sure where
it came from...
