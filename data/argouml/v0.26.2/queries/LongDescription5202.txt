This first occurs in 0.25.4 and seems to be a side effect of keeping the model
element properties tab enabled.

To reproduce place two classes on a diagram

Click on one and then ctrl-click the other. The properties tab is enabled and
visible but blank, this is good.

Click once on the diagram background and repeat the step above. This time the
property panel is visible. I prefer that the tab stay enabled with no visible
controls.
