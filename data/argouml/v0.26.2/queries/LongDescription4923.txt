I had a failing test in
org.argouml.kernel.TestProjectWithProfiles.testRemoveProfileWithModelThatRefersToProfile().
Initially I associated this with issue #4868, but, Tom thinks this isn't related.

Well, now, after having debugged this extensively, including looking into the
model (XMI within the ZARGO) which is being written by the test, I think that
there are indeed leftovers from the previous tests within the MDR repository.
Furthermore, I narrowed this on the MDRModelImplementation.umlPackage state when
the XMI is written. The proposed fix is simply to initialize the UmlPackage when
the MDRModelImplementation object is constructed:

Because this is an area of the code that I'm not familiar with I would
appreciate some feedback from experts. For the meantime I'll commit a failing
test which could be fixed with the above patch for others to verify.
