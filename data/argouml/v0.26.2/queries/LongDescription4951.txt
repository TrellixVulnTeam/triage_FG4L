I tested this with current SVN, r13938.

When you create a new shape, like for example a text area, you can resize its
box and set justification (left, center, right).

These settings are not saved, so closing and reopening the diagram makes the
text shapes of their original size and center-justified. The same applies to raw
rectangles.
