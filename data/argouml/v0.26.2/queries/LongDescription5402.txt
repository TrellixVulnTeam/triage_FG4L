1. Create a class and a package on a class-diagram.
2. Select the package by clicking on it in the diagram.
3. Click the presentation tab in the details pane.
4. Select the class by clicking on it in the diagram.

Now the properties tab was activated. This is wrong - the presentation tab
should remain selected!

The same applies to all other types of modelelements, and all other tabs.

There are a few exceptions on this normal behaviour, all of which are explained
in issue 1925.

Maybe I'll try to create a decent spec description one day...
