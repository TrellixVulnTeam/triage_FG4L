There is an issue in the exported XMI file using ArgoUML .24 in the following 
situation:

1) Create a class diagram with class, ex: "Customer"
2) Create an operation for this class, ex: "sampleOperation"
3) Add an input parameter to the operation.  Note, by default ArgoUML selects 
this as an "in" parameter
4) Save the model, and export the XMI

Observation:  The XMI is missing the "kind" attribute on the parameter section, 
see sample:

... name = 'param1' isSpecification = 'false'> ...

This can be fixed as follows:

in step #3 above, user must explicitly click on "in" radio option which is 
already selected by default.  If doing this, the XMI is generated correctly:

... name = 'param1' isSpecification = 'false' kind = 'in'> ...

ArgoUML should by default select the internal setting necessary so that the UI 
radio button selection of "in" matches what is exported in XMI without 
requiring user to click on "in" when it is already selected.
