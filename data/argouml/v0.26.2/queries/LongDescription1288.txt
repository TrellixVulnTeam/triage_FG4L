Go to the menu dialog Edit->Settings-Fonts and pick a general font
size other than "Normal size". Upon clicking Ok or Apply, the font
size of most text will change, except for the names of objects such
classes and packages. They are still in a tiny font size, both in the
diagram and in the properties.

In the properties section of the window it is really strange to see
the class name really small ("Normal") but all of the other text in
the properties be what I selected ("Large").
