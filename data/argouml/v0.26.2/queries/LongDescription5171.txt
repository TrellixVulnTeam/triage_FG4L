Activating the Fig popup menu for a critic does not show the critic text.
Instead it now shows (for a class named "Test") the text "This branch contains
"to do" items related to the model element Class: Test".

In V0.24, ArgoUML correctly showed the full description of the critic that was
selected in the pop-up menu.

1. Create a class with a few attributes with the same name.
2. right-click on the class, select in the popup menu: Critiques -> Revise
Attribute Names to Avoid Conflict.
The todo pane now correctly shows the red selected critic (under Medium
priority). But the details pane shows the "ToDo Item" tab selected, with the
text "This branch...".
