The Model API currently specifies the use of a Writer instead of an OutputStream
for the XmiWriters.  Both MDR and eUML want an OutputStream and an Writer can
easily be created from an OutputStream, but not vice versa, so I propose to
change the API to pass an OutputStream and writers that need to can wrap it with
a Writer (typically a PrintWriter).

Additionally the current save code writes out temporary files, then reads them
back in and throws away the first two lines before merging them into the .uml
file.  This is an expensive kludge that I'll refactor as an filter OutputStream
that modifies the output as it passes through.
