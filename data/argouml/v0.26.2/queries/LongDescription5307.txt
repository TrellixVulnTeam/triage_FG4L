Drawing a classifierRole on a collaboration diagram with the diagram tool
creates a multiplicity outside the model in the XMI.
Also, clicking on the toolbelt icons of a classifierRole needs testing.
There is something wrong with the creation of a Multiplicity in MDR.

I can only reproduce this problem on my laptop - not on my desktop PC.
The differences: the laptop uses Java 1.6 and Eclipse 3.3, the desktop Java 1.5
and Ecliopse 3.4.
Is this a Java 1.6 problem?
