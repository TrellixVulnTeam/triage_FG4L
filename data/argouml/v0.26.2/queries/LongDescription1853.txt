Aggregation when shift-hovering over class

There is a feature partly implemented on a class diagram, which I never 
spotted before - ArgoUML keeps surprising me!
When you normally click on a class, it becomes selected. If you then 
hover with the mouse over the class, its "tentacles" appear (I do not 
know how you name these things), in case 2 icons for Generalisation, 2 
for association, and a self-association. But if you press the shift key, 
and then hover, you get instead of a simple association, a Composition 
icon.
Regretfully, when you click the Composition icon, a class is created with 
a simple association, not composition...
It does work if you click and drag to an existing class.
Also, when pressing the shift key when the "tentacles" are already 
visible, they do not inmediately change; only after they disappear & 
appear again, or after some other changes.
