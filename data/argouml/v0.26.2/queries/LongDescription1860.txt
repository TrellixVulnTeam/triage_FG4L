In a new project I started, I originally used the default class
diagram for my data model classes.  I've now decided I'd prefer that
diagram to appear within the package in the package hierarchy (on the
Package-centric view) that contains those classes; I know it's
possible to have it in there as I can create a new diagram there with
no problem, but I can't find any way to move the existing one.  The
edit menu's cut/copy & paste options are disabled when I select it in
the explorer, and I don't really want to have to hack around in the
XMI file with a text editor...
