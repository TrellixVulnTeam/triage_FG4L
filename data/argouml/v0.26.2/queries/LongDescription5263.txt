This happens either in File > Properties > Profiles and in 
Edit > Settings > Profiles,

the intended behavior of the unload button is for unloading only available
profiles, but since it appears on the right side of the window it seems it could
be used to unload active profiles too.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to "File > Properties > Profiles", select a profile in the "active
profiles" list

2. Click in the "Unload" button under the "active profiles" list, nothing happens
