Some tabs in the Edit --> Settings dialog only specify the defaults to be used
for new diagrams. These settings are not supposed to influence the current
project. This should at least be indicated by a string saying something like
"These are default settings which are applied to newly created projects.". In
addition, there could be a button "Configure project specific settings..." which
leads to the File --> Properties dialog.

There are 4 tabs in the settings dialog for which this addition would be
good:  User, Profiles, Notations, Diagram Appearance.
