Hide association names in diagramm when there are many associations, the 
diagram is unreadable.

Implementation:
* Add "Show association names" to Project and and Argo settings, Notation tab, 
just after "Show guillemots", default value is "true/on"
* Don't show association text (return empty string) in 
AssociationNameNotationUml.toString()
