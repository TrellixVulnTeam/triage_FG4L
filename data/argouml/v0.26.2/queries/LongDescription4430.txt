Steps to reproduce:
- click on a class attribute (or create a new project, create a class and add an
int attribute)
- in the property panel, click on the "initial value" body field (the one on the
left)
- add a couple of tabs and maybe some text

The field scrolls, but the scrolling bar hides the text (at least on my
machine)! See also the attachment. Note that the language field on the right
scrolls smoothly.

Moreover: the text vertical alignment in the language field is not pursuant to
the the body field.
