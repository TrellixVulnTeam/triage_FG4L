Because of the Fix for issue 5211, a class without namespace can be created:

1. in a new model, add a new class to the class diagram and name it 'A'
2. add a new attribute by double clicking on the attribute compartement
   ==> newAttr : Integer is created
3. double click on the attribute so you can edit it in the diagram
4. append ';a:Foo' to it and hit ENTER
   ==> A now has 2 attributes
   ==> attribute a has type Foo (class), which cannot be found in the model

Save and load works, but there is no way to select or delete Foo.
