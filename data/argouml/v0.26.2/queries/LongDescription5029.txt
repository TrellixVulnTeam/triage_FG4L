The current implementation of the Profiles Subsystem requires the profile
creator to write lot's of code in order to add simple features as critics and
images to stereotypes. This approach is error prone and is not "forward" compatible.

MY proposal is: put the maximum of configurations possible in configuration
files and write some code to interpret this files and register the proper
critics, checklists and so on...

Desired requeriment:it should to be possible to specify a (simple) profile
without refering to any ArgoUML class.
