We need to enable the source tab for all the models or figures and have the 
java source be empty for those models or figures which are not class model or 
figure.

We used models and figures other than class model or figure to represent 
database entities such as schemas (and more), but we cannot show the generated 
statements because we cannot easily extend and instantiate 
org.argouml.uml.ui.TabSrc.

That is because TabSrc is internally instantiated through a java reflection 
and it seems to not be possible to instantiated it outside of argouml code.
