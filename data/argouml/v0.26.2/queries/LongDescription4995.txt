If a client of ArgoEventPump adds a listener for a specific event type (e.g. 
ArgoEventTypes.STATUS_TEXT) it incorrectly receives notifications for other 
similiar event types (e.g. STATUS_PROJECT_SAVED, STATUS_PROJECT_MODIFIED).  To 
Recreate: 

1. Add a listener for ArgoEventType.STATUS_TEXT to call an implementation of 
ArgoStatusEventListener.statusText(ArgoStatusEvent e).  Set a breakpoint in 
this method.
2. Fire an event for ArgoEventTypes.STATUS_PROJECT_SAVED.  The ArgoEventPump 
will incorrectly call the listener for ArgoEventType.STATUS_TEXT thereby 
hitting the breakpoint in ArgoStatusEventListener.statusText(ArgoStatusEvent e).

This behavior does not seem correct but fixing it may uncover other issues 
where code has inadvertently come to rely on this behavior.  That should be 
considered before applying the fix.
