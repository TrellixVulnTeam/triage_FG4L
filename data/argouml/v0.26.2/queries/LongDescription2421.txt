Focus on zoom slider not set; clicking the zoom icon a 2nd time does not 
remove the slider panel.

The Toolbar of ArgoUML contains now the new zoom-slider widget.

The problem scenario:
1. Click on the toolbar icon for zoom, and a slider panel opens. 
2. Click again on the same icon, it does not close. It should!


The same thing works OK in the following scenario:
1. Click on the toolbar icon for zoom, and a slider panel opens. 
2. Click on the slider "knob", and it turns blue, to indicate (keyboard) focus.
3. Click on the zoom icon, and the panel closes.

Hence the reason of the problem:
The keyboard focus is not set to a visible location when the panel is opened.
This also blocks keyboard operation of the widget.
Once you click somewhere on the slider, then the focus is set, and the widget 
becomes operationable with the keyboard.
