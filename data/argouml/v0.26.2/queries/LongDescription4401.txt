I've found this comment in the UML 1.4.2 specificiation (bottom of page 211) -
"A string entry within the operation compartment maps into an
Operation or a Method within the Class corresponding to the class
symbol..........
If the entry has the keyword «signal», then it maps into a Reception
on the Class instead."

So it seems that Receptions are supposed to appear in the operations
compartment with the keyword «signal» to differentiate it.
