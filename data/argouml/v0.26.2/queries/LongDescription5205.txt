TabProps.createPropPanel examines all its PropPanelFactories in order till it
finds the correct one to to use for the given target.

The sequence2 module has registered a PropPanelFactory but this is never found
becuase ArgoUML's own ElementPropPanelFactory is found first.

I plan to change the PropPanelFactoryManager so that newly added factories are
added at the start of the list instead of the end. This way modules can override
our own default panels.
