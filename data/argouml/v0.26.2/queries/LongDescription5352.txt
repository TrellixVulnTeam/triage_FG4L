Project.postLoad() takes tens of seconds to complete for large projects.  The issue appears
to be that:

- every Fig registers itself with the ArgoEventPump
- the ArgoEventPump keeps its registered listeners in a single linear list
- Fig*ModelElement.postLoad() calls ArgoEventPump.removeListener before calling addListener,
even though it's never registered anything
- removeListener() does a linear search of the long list
