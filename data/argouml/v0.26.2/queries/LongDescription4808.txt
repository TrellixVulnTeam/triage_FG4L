I'm modeling several objects and I created a root package (i.e. say pack_a) and
several inner packages that contain the objects (i.e. pack_b, pack_c).

When I create an association between to objects (say two classes) the
association is not created in the package where the Diagram is located (i.e.
pack_a.pack_b) instead it is created in my root package
(i.e. pack_a). Furthermore the namespace box of the association only
shows my root package, so it's impossible to move it, not even by
drag&drop.

This behavior is also the same with Use Case diagrams where the Use Case class
and the Actor class are in different packages.

Attached are some images of the problem.
