The property panel for tag definitions does not alow setting the type of the 
tag.

Below I attach a patch for 'argouml' and another for 'argouml-core-model-mdr', 
and a gif which is a icon for metatypes, which allow users to set the type of 
the tagdefinition, according to what id defined in UML 1.4.
