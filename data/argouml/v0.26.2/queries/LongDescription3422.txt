Taken from issue 3230.

The Path setting is present on the Presentation tab for all node 
modelelements, and is persistent. It shows the path behind a "::" - try e.g. 
with a class inside a package.

This kind of setting normally require a popup menu item: Show -> Show Path and 
Show -> Hide Path. One of these is to be shown appropriately.
