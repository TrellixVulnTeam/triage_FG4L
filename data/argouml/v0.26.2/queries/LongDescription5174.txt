When selecting a CallState on the diagram, the ActionState proppanel is shown -
only the icon at the top of the proppanel is the correct one.

The difference lays e.g. in the popup that you get on the Entry Action field: It
should only allow to enter a new CallAction, not all 8 types.

This is regression - it worked correctly in V0.24.
