All Figs must exist within a Layer in the diagram. It should not be possible to
set the Layer of a Fig to null.

I've been considering chaning this method in GEF to throw an
IllegalArgumentException if receiving null.

    /** Sets the Layer that this Fig belongs to. Fires PropertyChangeEvent
     *  "layer". */
    void setLayer(Layer lay) {
        firePropChange("layer", _layer, lay);
        _layer = lay;
    }

However I am far from a GEF release at the moment and so I plan to put this into
FigNodeModelElement and FigEdgeModelElement.

This constraint may help to discover the LAYER_NULL problem in persistence files.
