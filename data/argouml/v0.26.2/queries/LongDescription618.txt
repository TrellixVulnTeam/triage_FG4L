There are several cases where critics have the same headline, but different
meanings. This is 
confusing. They should be a single critic OR the headlines
should be different.

Very often 
the only difference is the diagram or artifact
that triggers them. E.g. "Set classifier" which 
has a variant for deployment
diagrams and a variant for sequence diagrams. At the very least 
these should be differentiated by diagram name "Set classifier (deployment diagram)" if they 
must be deemed separate critics.
