The explorer pop-up menu of many less-used modelelements (e.g. Exception,
StateMachine, Stereotype, ComponentInstance) shows a "New Stereotype" menu item.

This is a bug, a stereotype should be contained only in a Package with
stereotype <<profile>> according WFR 5 for a stereotype.

For usability, and since the mechanism to build the entries of this menu does
not allow checking of a stereotype, it would be better to show this entry on all
Packages.

This issue can be solved by moving the entry for Stereotype in the
validContainmentMap from ModelElement to Package in UmlFactoryMDRImpl.java.

Since I already adapted the manual (line 12851) with a stub, this needs to be
completed.
