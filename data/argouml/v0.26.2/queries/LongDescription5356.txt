When selecting the Save All Graphics function, you have to enter a target
directory for the generated graphics of all diagrams.

If you run this feature many times into the same dir, then you need to confirm
overwrite all the time; for each diagram. For every diagram a dialog pops up:
"Do you want to overwrite nnnn?" There are 2 buttons: yes and no.

This issue requests to enhance this with a button "Yes to All", which would
reduce the number of confirmations to one.
