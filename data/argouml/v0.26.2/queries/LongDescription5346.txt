The profile subsystem is apparently writing raw internal class names out as part of the
project save and then using reflection to attempt to reload them again.  This is fragile
and prone to breakage as we've seen with the PGML files.  As a matter of fact, I already
have a bunch of files which won't load because the profiles were apparently refactored
from org.argouml.uml.profiles to org.argouml.profiles.internal.

Whatever gets saved in our output files should be a stable identifier decoupled from our
internal implementation.
