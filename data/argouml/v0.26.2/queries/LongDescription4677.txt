I have a defined class and I want to drag it into a defined package in the left 
window. (Package centric or class centric views). It does not allow. I was able 
to do that for some classes into a package, but not this one. Note: this 
package is alongside the classes I was able to drag and drop.

Would suggest maybe being able to manually edit that on the Properties of a 
class.
