To duplicate this:
1. Create a new file MyInterface.java with the following contents:

package my.test;
public interface MyInterface
{
    public static final String KEY_A = "apple";
    public static final String KEY_B = "banana";
}

2. Create a new project in ArgoUML
3. Import this source file you just created (File->Import Sources...)
4. Go to the class diagram in the my/test package
5. Go to the Presentation tab and check the "Operations" box.  The interface
object displayed in the diagram will show no operations.  That makes sense,
since it doesn't have any.
6. Go to the Properties tab. Two items appear in the Operations box, KEY_A and
KEY_B.  They do not appear in the class diagram.

So the question is, is there a way to get these two "operations"
(constants/members actually) displayed in the diagram?
