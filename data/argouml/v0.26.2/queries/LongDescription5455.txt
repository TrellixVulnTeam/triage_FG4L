When selecting a association or generalization in the explorer and trying to use
the "add to diagram" feature from it's popup menu, a cross curser is shown in
the diagram, but on click the element is not added and the curser returns to
normal mode. Expected: model element added to the diagram (class diagram), seems
to get broken...
