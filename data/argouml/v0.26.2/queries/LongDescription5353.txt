The NetBeans MDR implementation supports transactions with standard commit/rollback semantics
for writing as well as read-only transactions.  If the caller isn't using transactions,
MDR will wrap each operation in a separate transaction.  This has a significant overhead,
particularly if large numbers of MDR operations are being performed for a single logical
ArgoUML function.
