There are a few problems with the Configure Shortcuts feature:

1. The overview table in Edit=>Settings=>Configure Shortcuts contains 3 unnamed
actions at the top. One of them has the shortcut CTRL+A.

2. There are 2 actions with a wrong i18n: action.adjust-grid-lines-32 and
action.adjust-grid-lines-none are shown as such.

3. If I add a shortcut to a function that does not have one, I always get :
Problem with saving; Impossible to save shortcuts: conflicts found.
This really ruins the feature...
