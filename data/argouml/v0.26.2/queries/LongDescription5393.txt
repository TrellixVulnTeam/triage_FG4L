When creating a diagram for a profile, and using the diagram toolbar tools to
draw something on the diagram, ArgoUML causes a ClosureViolationException.
The effect for the user is that ArgoUML shows the Fig on the drawing, and when
clicking to place the Fig, that works, but there is still a Fig attached to the
mouse cursor.
So, every click, a new Fig is placed.

The new Figs are representing a modelelement not in any namespace.
