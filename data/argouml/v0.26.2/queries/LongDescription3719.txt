When adding vertical space in a diagram, it is not added where the user would
expect it. This seems to happen, because the start point for 'Add Vertical
space' is not correctly determined. But I don't really know the reason. 

In the attached File "Inaccurate 'Add Verctical Space tool'.swf" You can see
that although I place the starting point between a message and its respond the
space is added above the message rather than in between message and respond. How
ever if i move further down with the starting point it is eventually detected
correctly
