Test case:
1. let a class diagram be the current diagram
2. select more than one class/interface in the explorer
3. open the popup menu: "add to diagram" is enabled
4. choose this option or drag the selected elements onto the diagram

Problem: in both cases only one element is added (without any hint/log)
