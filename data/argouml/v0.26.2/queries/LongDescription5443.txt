On the properties panel of a transition, the fields for Trigger, Guard and
Effect do not show any popup menus.

They did show correctly in V0.24, so this is regression.
Since they are essential for selecting e.g. reused trigger events, this is a
major issue (not so much for guards, since they are not reused) -> P1.

This is definitively a issue to be solved in a maintenance release (V0.26.1).
