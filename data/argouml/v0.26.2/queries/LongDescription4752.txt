This seems to be the reintroduction of an old bug (but I can't find the issue).
Presumably some recent change in the module loader architecture has caused this.

If you currently run with the dev module the dev module panel does not appear.

However if you you to Edit->Settings modules you will see the module is not enabled.

When you close the settings dialog the module then appears.
