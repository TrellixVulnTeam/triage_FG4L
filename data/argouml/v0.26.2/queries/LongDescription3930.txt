If more than one element is selected in the Explorer pan, the Add to Diagram
operation isn't available on the context menu.  There's no reason for this to be
disabled.  For Class Diagrams there's a workaround of using the Add all Classes
in Namespace command for the diagram, but there's no such workaround for
Activity diagrams and adding each item individually is tedious.
