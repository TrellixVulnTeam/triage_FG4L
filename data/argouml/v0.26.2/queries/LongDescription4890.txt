On the Operation proppanel, there are checkboxes for abstract and leaf.
These do not follow target changes, i.e. when you click on an operation of a
class in the diagram, and then on another, the state of the second operation is
not correctly shown, but the values of the first one are retained.

The other "Modifier" checkboxes work fine.
