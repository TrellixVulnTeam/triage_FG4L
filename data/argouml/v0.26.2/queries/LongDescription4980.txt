Support relocation of all diagram types.
The user can invoke this function by drag & drop in the explorer, or by
selecting another entry in the "Home Model" combo on the properties panel of the
diagram.

This means completion of the implementation of the "Relocatable" interface
operations in all diagrams.

Already works:
UMLDeploymentDiagram
UMLClassDiagram
UMLUseCaseDiagram

Still to implement:
UMLActivityDiagram
UMLCollaborationDiagram
UMLSequenceDiagram
UMLStateDiagram
