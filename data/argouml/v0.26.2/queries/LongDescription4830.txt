When selecting a diagram element, such as a class, actor, etc., the properties
panels fields register listeners to the model for changes, so that the
propertiespanels get updated when the model changes.

These listeners are not removed after target selectiopn, but new ones are added
with every time an element is selected.

This does not apply to all the prop panel fields, e.g. these are correct:
UMLClassifierAssociationEndListModel,
UMLGeneralizableElementGeneralizationListModel.

These are wrong:
org.argouml.uml.ui.foundation.core.UMLGeneralizableElementAbstractCheckBox
org.argouml.uml.ui.UMLDerivedCheckBox
org.argouml.uml.ui.foundation.core.UMLGeneralizableElementLeafCheckBox
org.argouml.uml.ui.foundation.core.UMLGeneralizableElementRootCheckBox
org.argouml.uml.ui.foundation.core.UMLModelElementVisibilityRadioButtonPanel
and most others.

How to test this:
Use the Run Configuration named "ArgoUML dev".
When ArgoUML started, select in the menu Edit-> Settings, and press OK inmediately. 
Draw a class, select and unselect it e.g. 5 times.
Use the Model Listeners tab at the right: It shows 5 listeners for many
proppanel fields.
