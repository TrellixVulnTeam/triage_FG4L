The argouml application icon has been updated (see
http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4981).  The icon on the taskbar
and title bar are displayed correctly.  However, in WinXP (and possibly other
OSs), the icon shown during alt-tab task switching is blurred, see attached image.

Expected cause: 16x16 icon is being scaled up to 32x32.

The icon displayed during alt-tab task switching should be 32x32.
