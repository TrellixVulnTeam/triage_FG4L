When reverse engineering classes, the class and method comments aren't imported,
and there doesn't seem to be a setting that will allow this.

Steps to Reproduce
(1) Select File/Import Sources
(2) Select the starting directory, and make any classpath settings.  The "Level
of import detail:" radio button is set to "Full Import".
(3) Create a class diagram, and add the classes to the diagram.
(3) Click on a class or interface, click on the "Documentation" tab at the
bottom of the window.  Note that the Documentation field in the tab panel is empty.

If you add a comment in the "Documentation" field, and view the source you will
see that the comment is generated correctly.
