CoreHelperMDRImpl.isValidNamespace() is using Facade.getModel() which returns
the innermost containing model instead of the outermost containing model when
trying to determine if elements are from two different containment hierarchies.
 This causes it to return false for elements which should be legal namespace
candidates.
