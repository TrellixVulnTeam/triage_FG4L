Hi,
I wanted to select 0.24beta2 for the version, but there isn't in the list.

Before I test version 0.24beta2, I removed my ~/argo.user.properties file.
ArgoUML start in french, fine I'm french. :)
How do ArgoUML know it have to start in french at the first start?

The problem is that the interface is in french and in the preferences,
Appearence tab, in language list, "en (English)" is selected instead of "fr
français - Default".
If I select french and close ArgoUML, I have "argo.locale=fr" in
argo.user.properties
I open ArgoUML again and here I have "fr" selected in the language list.

I think the problem is when there is no "argo.locale" variable in
argo.user.properties, ArgoUML guess the language, but it is not synchronised
with the language list.
When there is "argo.locale" variable, ArgoUML start with the specified language
and it is synchronised with the language list.

Do you understand my bug? :)
