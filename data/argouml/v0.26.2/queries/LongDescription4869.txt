In trunk, rev. 13626; running in Eclipse, "ArgoUML debug" configuration.
Steps to reproduce:
After starting ArgoUML, menu "Edit"/"Configure Perspectives..." then select the
2nd perspective (i.e., "Class-centric") and press "OK" button.

RESULTS:
Some time passes and then the Exception occurs.
Exception occurred during event dispatching:
java.lang.StackOverflowError

You must press "Cancel" to exit from the dialog and "Package-centric" will not
be available anymore.
