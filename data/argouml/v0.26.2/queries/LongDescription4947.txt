When you create a project in V0.24 of ArgoUML with an Activity diagram with e.g.
Initial states, final states and choices, then when loaded in the current SVN
version, these Figs are relocated at 0,0 coordinates.

This applies to all Pseudostates and the Final state in both activity and
statechart diagrams.
