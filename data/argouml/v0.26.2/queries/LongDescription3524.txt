I can multi-select multiple operations from a class in the explorer (tree) but I
cannot cut/copy and paste them.

I was moving some operations and attributes from one class to another.  I had to
do this one at a time.  Very slow.  It would have been very helpful to be able
to move or copy them all at once.

Somewhat related to issue 2552 except you aren't using the property tabs.
