I found two problems with this setting.

a) When you add a class to a class diagram outside the class package, it shows 
the full path in the class name. That's ok. 
But, when you right-click on it, the "show" submenu shows "Show Path in Name" 
instead of the "hide" option since it's already shown. So, you need to press 
the "show" and then right-click again and select the "hide" option.


b) When you save the project, close it and then open it, this setting gets 
lost. I think ArgoUML should keep that setting saved for each diagram in a 
separate manner, because you could want to show the path in one diagram but not 
in another.

Hope it helps.

Ely.
