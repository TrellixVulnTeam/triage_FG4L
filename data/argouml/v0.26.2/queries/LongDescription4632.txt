If you select the Generalization tool on a class diagram and attempt to draw a
generalization from a Class to an Interface, it acts as if the Interface figure
isn't in the diagram.  On the other hand, if you use the Generalization tool
from the quick toolbelt buton on a Class figure, it will allow you to generalize
an Interface from a Class.  These two modes of creating a Generalization should
behave the same.
