Other comboboxes should be consider also.

The selectable items in the combo should not be build on construction or on
target change. They should only be built when the user drops down the combo
selection list. Some visual indicator of work in progress would be useful.

Classing as defect because of the excessive time that this can take during
target change with large models.
