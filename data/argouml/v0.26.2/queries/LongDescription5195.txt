In the "View" menu, the item between "Adjust Snap" and "Toolbars" has no label.
Clicking on it triggers some activity, as the memory usage bar shows, but no
visible result.

Bythe way, there are some unlocalized (that is, not even in English) strings in
the "Adjust Grid" menu, they are shown just like this in the GUI:
 - menu.item.lines-32
 - menu.item.lines-none

Note: I use the French localized version, but I guess this is not just a
translation problem. Sorry I couldn't find how to change the locale for ArgoUML
under WinXP :-/

Thanks,
Nicolas.
