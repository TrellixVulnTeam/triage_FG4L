The ElementImport has no property panel.

You can make this visible as follows:
1. Draw a class and a package.
2. Select the package.
3. In its properties panel, rightclick on the "Imported Elements" field, and
select Add.
4. Add the class.
5. Select the "Composite-Centric" perspective (if you do not have this explorer
perspective, then press Restore Defaults in the Configure Perspectives dialog).
Now the ElementImport is visible below the package in the explorer.
