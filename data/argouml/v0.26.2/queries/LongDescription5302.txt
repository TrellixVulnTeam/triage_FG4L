When a project is exported as XMI, a dialog showing a NullPointerException (see
below) occurs if the project has no name yet, i.e. it has never been saved.

As a work-around, you should save the project first (as a zargo file), since
this solves the problem.

Reproduce as follows:
1. Start ArgoUML.
2. Draw a class or something.
3. Export as XMI, type in a filename "test".
The error dialog appears: «Problem while saving: A problem occurred while
saving: "null". Your file may be corrupted. Please file a bugreport at
www.argouml.org»
