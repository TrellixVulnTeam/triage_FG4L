This definitely affects FigAssociations, but it may affect other subclasses of FigEdge
as well.  The intersects() method for FigEdge only checks for intersection of the child
path item Figs if they are in a Layer (ie getLayer != null).  It doesn't really make sense
to me that a composite figure could have some if its children in a different layer (or
no layer) and clearly this requirement isn't uniformly enforced since sometimes the labels
are drawn and some aren't.

I've got a patch for FigEdgeModelElement which fixes the particular symptoms that I've
been looking at, but I'm not sure where the real fix needs to go.
