Drawing an association class on the diagram between 2 classes does create
another hidden class in the model, which is not owned by any namespace. Hence it
is only visible via the View->XML Dump feature.

Repeatingly saving and loading a project that contains this rogue class does
give an exception -> data lost -> P2.

This issue gives the same effect as issue 5227.

Bob already discovered (as described in issue 5227) that this class is created
at creation time of the association class - I only saw it after deleting the
project.
