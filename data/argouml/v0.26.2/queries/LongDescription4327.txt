The notation language indicated in a zargo file is not applied while loading the
zargo, but only after it is loaded.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Select default language UML.
2. Draw a class, with an attrinute and an operation.
3. Select the File->Notation Java. You see the attribute and operation notation
change.
4. Save.
5. Load. This shows the UML notation for the attribute and operation. However,
in the File->Notation menu, Java is correctly indicated.
