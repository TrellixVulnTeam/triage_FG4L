When exporting a diagram to PNG format, in some cases horizontal bands are blanked.
This happens for association end names, for horizontal associations.

Reproduce as follows:
Draw two classes next to each other.
Draw several associations with named ends between them (horizontal lines!)
Export to PNG.

If you do not see the bottom or top of a line of text missing, then try to
select all (CTRL-A), and shift the diagram a bit up or down.
