The classes ActionGoToCritique, TabToDo, ToDoPane, and WizStep in org.argouml.cognitive.ui
all depend on the ProjectBrowser to communicate with each other. They should instead register
the appropriate event listeners and communicate through the event dispatcher to allow
them to be decoupled from the ProjectBrowser.

The following methods that they use will be deprecated and removed: 

ProjectBrowser.getTab(TabToDo.class) 
ProjectBrowser.getTodoPane()
ProjectBrowser.setToDoItem()
DetailsPane.setTodoItem()
