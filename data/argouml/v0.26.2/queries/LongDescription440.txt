One should be able to add actors (and I belive all other classifiers to a 
static structure diagram (aka Class Diagram).

The following code is to restricted (though there may be reasons for it):
(from 
src_new/org/argouml/uml/diagram/static_structure/ClassDiagramGraphModel.java)

  /** Return true if the given object is a valid node in this graph */
  public boolean canAddNode(Object node) {
    if (_nodes.contains(node)) return false;
    return (node instanceof MClass) || (node instanceof MInterface)
    || (node instanceof MModel)  || (node instanceof MPackage) || (node 
instanceof MInstance);
  }
