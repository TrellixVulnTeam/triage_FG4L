Save ArgoUML log in the home directory

I haven't tested it yet, but I feel that running argouml with a restricted
account will break, or at least, don't log anything, if argouml runs in a
read-only directory. 

This is more important now because we are thinking about creating installers,
that I assume that will copy argouml binaries in the program folders of each OS
(see issue 3705).

So I propose logging into the same dir that the config is saved, now at
$HOME/.argouml.

PS: I know that I shouldn't fill a bug without verifying that it exists, but I
prefer having tomorrow an invalid issue than forgiving a possible bug.
