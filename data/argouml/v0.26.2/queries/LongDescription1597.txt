How to reproduce the fault: 
1) create a new project 
2) insert two use cases in a diagram, where one extends the other 
3) Save & Reload 
 
Fault 1) 
select "Show Extension Point" for the extended use case 
  -> extension point is NOT shown 
 (the property tab lists the extension point for the base use case) 
 
Fault 2) 
select the extension (in the diagram) 
  -> the property tab doesn't list any use case in the list "Extending Usecase" 
 
See the attached example project.
