I have noticed that if you do a reverse engineer that immediately there is an
error of some kind the system kicks back to the ImportCommon.doImportInternal
function, and effectively the import is ended.

Would it make more sense for the system to continue to try and complete the
import, and for each of the reverse engineer modules to feedback a list of
problems to the main routing for reporting to the user?
