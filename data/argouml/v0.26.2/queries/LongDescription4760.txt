I'm currently working with some use cases and extension points.  I want to be
able to apply the same stereotypes/tagged values to both the use case and the
extension point.  To do this, I created two different stereotypes (with
different Base Classes (ExtensionPoint, and UseCase) and then assigned the same
set of Tagged Values to both.  When I applied the stereotypes, the Tagged Values
in the Extension Point don't appear in the ComboBox in the Tagged Values pane.

Steps to Reproduce:
(1) Create two stereotype (A & B).
(2) Create a Tagged Value called "Priority" for Stereotype A.
(3) Repeat the step for Stereotype B.
(4) Assign the stereotypes to separate use cases.
(5) Open the Tagged Values pane, and click on the first use case.  Verify that
"Priority" appears in the combo box.
(6) Click the second use case.
(7) Verify that the combo box does NOT include the "Priority" tagged value,
despite the fact that it appears properly in the explorer tree on the left of
the Window.
