After the introduction of profiles in ArgoUML, there are several possibilities
for the loading of a *.zargo file to fail due to problems with profiles'
persistence. This issue intends that the error messages from the failure of
loading due to profile errors - or non-existing references to external model
elements - to be more clear and to help the user to identify and fix the problem.

The failure scenarios are several:
 * failure to load a user defined profile contained in the *.zargo file;
 * a qualified model reference (i.e., xmi.idref =
"http://domain/blabla.xmi#.:000877897") isn't found because the reference
resolver has no knowledge on how to resolve the reference;
 * a plugin profile from which the model in a *.zargo file depends isn't
available, probably because the user has no such module in his installation of
ArgoUML;
 * more?

I think that the most difficult to present in a friendly way to the user is the
one related to a qualified reference, since the exception is thrown by MDR
internals. The XmiReferenceResolverImpl class has some possibility to know that
an exception will occur when it is unable to resolve a reference, but, part of
its design is to hand the resolving to parent if it isn't successful...

The other two scenarios should be possible to solve by modularizing a bit the
ProfileConfigurationFilePersister.load(Project p, InputStream is) method.
