The method isValidNamspace() automatically excludes any namespaces which have a different
root namespace.  I suspect this was originally introduced to prevent assigning elements
from the user model to a profile model.  It could still be useful for that purpose, but
it has (at least) a couple of negative side effects:

  - elements with no namespace set (effectively their own root elements) can't be assigned
to any valid namepspace
  - elements can't be moved from one (sub-) model to another
