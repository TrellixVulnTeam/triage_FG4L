Resizing a composite state does not resize and reposition the concurrent regions
correctly.

Nor does the composite state resize when concurrent regions are removed.

I wanted to be sure that my local changes didn't cause this. I can confirm this
bug exists previously in 0.25.4

The attached shows an example of a selected concurrent region after a resize.
