If you open an XMI file and then go to save it as an ArgoUML project, the file
save dialog defaults to your home directory.  It should default to the same
directory that the original XMI file was opened from and the default project
name should be the same as the base name of the XMI file.  In other words, if
you open Foo.xml or Foo.xmi, the default project name should be Foo.zargo.
