You can remove all profiles in the edit settings dialog, but still the UML
1.4 profile gets used/loaded.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to Edit > Settings > Profiles, remove the UML profile from the default
configuration

2. create a new project, the UML should not be there

3. restart ArgoUML, the UML profile will be loaded and will reappear in the
defailt configuration
