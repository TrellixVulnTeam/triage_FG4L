~/argo.user.properties should be ~/.argo.user.properties to match the behavior
expected of applications on UNIX-compatible operating systems. The inability to
either hide or delete it without consequences results in a great deal of
distraction and irritation whenever I pass through my home directory on the way
to a document.

This is made worse by the fact that it is one of only two entries which remain
in defiance of the expected behavior. (The other being the directory ~/freemind,
also created by a Java application)

As the version I'm using (0.19.6) is the newest version Gentoo Linux offers, any
remedy must be backported at least that far to benefit me quickly.
