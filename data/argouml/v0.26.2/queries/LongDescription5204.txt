The following needs to be adapted before the release of v0.26 in the source code
of ArgoUML:

1. The AboutBox.getCredits() method to mention the contributing devs for 0.26.
the right persons are mentioned at
http://argouml.tigris.org/members/project_members.html.

2. The HelpBox.pages member to refer to the 0.26 manual online.

3. The Critic.defaultMoreInfoURL() method to refer to the 0.26 manual online.

BTW: There are also various webpages that need this kind of update.
