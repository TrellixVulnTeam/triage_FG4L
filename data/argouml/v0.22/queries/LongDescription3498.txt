With a use case selected, choose add a new use case diagram. The new use case 
diagram then
becomes a child of the selected use case. Change the name of the use case 
diagram. Click
in the use case diagram. The new name of the use case diagram is then correctly 
shown in the
explorer... but not in the title caption of ArgoUML.

Haven&apos;t checked other diagram types. Assume the problem exists there too.
