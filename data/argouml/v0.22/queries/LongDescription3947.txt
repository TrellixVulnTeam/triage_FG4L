I have created a sequence diagram for an use case. I have added to it some 
classified roles and some callings and returns, in one of the returns of a 
call the &apos;activity&apos; doens&apos;t finish at the point of the return and this causes 
that I can&apos;t insert new call at the lane. When I reload the seuqence diagram 
to check if the problem persist the white rectangle that indicates the 
duration of the call doesn&apos;t appear in any lane for any call and is imposible 
to add new calls.

This makes these diagrams impossible to use.
