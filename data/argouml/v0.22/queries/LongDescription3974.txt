If I change the name of a method or property in a class diagrams, it won&apos;t be
updated until I reload the diagram, or add a parameter. The same thing happens
if I change the visibility or modifier (static for example) of a method or property.

Although I&apos;m not sure, I believe that this bug was not present in the last
version I&apos;ve used (0.20.alpha5).
