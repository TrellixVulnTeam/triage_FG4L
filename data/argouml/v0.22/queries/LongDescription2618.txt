When I first create an association I see + and +, one for each role.

If I double click on a &quot;+&quot; and type in a role name &quot;foo&quot;, I now see &quot;++foo&quot;,
and the role name property is recorded as &quot;+foo&quot;.

To fix, the parsing of the in-diagram user-entered text must process 
and strip off any visibility characters (+, -, #).
