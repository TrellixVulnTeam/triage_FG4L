Activity diagrams vanish in a Package. That is how you can get the defect:
stand on the main Model folder;
right mouse click and choose from droped meniu &quot;Add Package&quot;;
new package appears;
rename the package;
there are some diagrams below, so i jus drag them one by one using right
mouse button and releasing over the package;
the package remains unchanged (i expected it should become expandable like a
diagram in the tree);
in selected package Properties Owned Elements I can see my diagrams, but
double click does not allow me to review them.
