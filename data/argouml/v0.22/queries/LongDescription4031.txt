Open the ArgoUML compatible (single file version) AndroMDA profile and look for
the TagDefinition @andromda.hibernate.generator.class which is owned by the
stereotype &lt;&lt;Entity&gt;&gt;.  The type of the TagDefinition should be
HibernateGeneratorClass but instead it shows up as what looks like an internal
xmi.id and is greyed out.
