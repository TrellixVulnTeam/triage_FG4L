Incorrect use of &quot;Remove&quot; in popup menu for action arguments:
Select an action. In the properties panel, there is a field Arguments.
Rightclick gives: &quot;New&quot; and &quot;Remove&quot;.
The latter is wrong according the terminology page of ArgoUML: it should be
&quot;Delete from Model&quot;.
