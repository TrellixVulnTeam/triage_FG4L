This issue requests to implement CallStates.

Currently, CallState is not yet implemented, since the UML1.3 spec only 
defines it as:
&quot;A call state is an action state that has exactly one call action as its entry 
action.&quot;, but there is no special notation defined. Hence implementing it 
would beter wait till UML 1.4, where its notation is specified as:
&quot;A call state is shown in the same way as an action state, except that the 
name of the operation of the call action is put in the symbol, along with the 
name of the classifier that hosts the operation in parentheses under it.&quot;
