Testcase:

1. start argouml 0.13.2
2. create a class and name it &apos;A&apos;
3. create an attr &apos;newAttr&apos; by doubleclicking in the attr compartment
4. create an oper by doubleclicking in the attr compartment
5. save project as &apos;test.zargo&apos;
6. make a copy of test.zargo
7. make new project (important!)
8. open test.zargo
9. save

Theoretically, the two .zargo files should be identically since there
were made no changes.
The following analysis reveals differences in the 5 files contained in
the zip file test.zargo. These differences should be fixed, because
they will affect the files iteratively at every save/load cycle.
(The test case is very simple. Ideally, the analysis should be done
with a project that has all diagram types and all cases in it.)

1. test.argo

The line
  &lt;searchpath href=&quot;PROJECT_DIR&quot; /&gt;
was added.

2. test.todo

OK, identical

3. test.xmi

OK, identical

4. test_ClassDiagram1.pgml

a strange empty FigGroup is added:
  &lt;group name=&quot;Fig1&quot;
       description=&quot;org.tigris.gef.presentation.FigGroup[0, 0, 0, 0]&quot;
       fill=&quot;1&quot;
       fillcolor=&quot;-1&quot;
       stroke=&quot;1&quot;
       strokecolor=&quot;-16777216&quot;
  &gt;
    &lt;private&gt;
    &lt;/private&gt;
    
  &lt;/group&gt;


5. test_UsecaseDiagram1.pgml

OK, identical (of course, it was empty)
