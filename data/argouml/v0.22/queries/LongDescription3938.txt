The button background for buttons with icons in the main tool bar and the
diagram toolbar don&apos;t match the toolbar background.  The toolbar background has
a gradient, while the buttons don&apos;t.  The highlight color is OK (if you rollover
or select a button), but the normal
background is a flat grey rather than having a gradient to match the look and
feel (the shiny metalic Java 5 L&amp;F).  This makes the toolbar look wierd with
alternating shiny and flat patches.

These tool bars appear to get created in GenericArgoMenu bar which in turn calls
code from the the org.tigris.toolbar project (an entire project for a toolbar?).
 I don&apos;t have a copy of that project, so I didn&apos;t chase it any further.
