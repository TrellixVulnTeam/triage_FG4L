in the checklist for a class attribute, there is this item:

&quot;does &lt;attribute&gt; apply to all instances of class &lt;attribute&gt; including
instances of subclasses?&quot;

it should read:

&quot;does &lt;attribute&gt; apply to all instances of class &lt;attribute&apos;s containing class&gt;
including instances of subclasses?&quot;
