There is a bug in Beta 3 which prevents you using the activity diagram 
for AndroMDA.

Here is what I&apos;ve done:
1) Import an XMI from Poseidon, which works well with AndroMDA (the 
PiggyBank example). Everything went fine.

2) If I add my activity diagram under the use case diagram I always get 
a new activity graph, so I have 2 activity graphs alltogether. I cannot 
add an activity diagram under the imported activity graph.
Please see the screenshot I attached.

3) This code, which works with Poseidon, won&apos;t work with ArgoUML:

Collection actionStates = getModel().getAllActionStates();
for (Iterator iterActionState = actionStates.iterator();
iterActionState.hasNext();) {
ActionStateFacade actionState =
(ActionStateFacade) iterActionState.next();

actionState is always &quot;null&quot;.

4) Importing the activity diagram from Poseidon works and the result can 
be processed by AndroMDA but if you are making the activity diagram from 
the beginning with ArgoUML, it won&apos;t work because of the error above 
(nr. 3).

So, it seems that ArgoUML still has a problem with activity diagram...
