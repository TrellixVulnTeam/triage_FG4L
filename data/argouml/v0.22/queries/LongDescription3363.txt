The following is from the users list, describing the problems:



Hi Marco,

Well, it is kind of possible to create such a ObjectFlowState, bound to a 
state, but you have to know which way works, and which way doesn&apos;t.

Implementing the ObjectFlowState in ArgoUML was one of the first Java 
additions I did, and there are some things missing and some things I would do 
differently now. The manual does not really describe it, AFAIK.

Let me guide you through - I suppose you use V0.18.1.

Create a class named &quot;Invoice&quot;.
Create a statechart diagram for it, with 2 states, named &quot;paid&quot; and &quot;unpaid&quot;.
Create an activity diagram for the package containing the Invoice class.
Draw a ObjectFlowState on it.
In the properties panel, select the dropdown labelled Type, and select the 
Invoice class.
The diagram now shows this name underlined.
Now double-click on the ObjectFlowState on the diagram, BELOW its name (in the 
white space). This will give you an empty edit box.
Enter the text &quot;paid&quot;, and press enter.

Since this state already exists, its name is recognized, and the text remains 
visible on the diagram.
If you enter something that is not a state of the class, it is refused.

But:
Since the properties panels do not show this link to the state, you can not 
alter it except by entering the text on the diagram.

And, apparently the state name disappears from the diagram after a save - load 
cycle :-( 
And the dashed transitions to and from the ObjectFlowState turn into full 
lines :-(
This used to work at the time I created this functionality...

Maybe I will try to improve all this some day...

Regards,
Michiel

Subject: [argouml-users] State into an ObjectFlowState?


&gt; Into an activity diagram one can put Activity and ObjectFlowState.
&gt; For an ObjectFlowState should be possible to specify a state for example
&gt; for an Invoice the state &quot;paid&quot; or &quot;unpaid&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I have not found where to put it. It&apos;s a missing functionality?
