Steps to reproduce:
- open a project, and save it into a removable media (e.g. an usb drive, or a
network shared folder)
- unplug the above media
- do a small modification to the project and resave the file

Argo pops up a message box with a text like &quot;A problem has occured.. your file
can be corrupted.. please report a bug at www.argouml.org&quot;. Then, it also pops
up a message box with the stack trace of the FileNotFoundException thrown.

I don&apos;t think this is the right behavior. Argo should pop up a message box with
a nicer text.. something like: &quot;The former file for this project is currently
unavailable. Please choose another location to save it.&quot;, and eventually open a
save FileChooser.
