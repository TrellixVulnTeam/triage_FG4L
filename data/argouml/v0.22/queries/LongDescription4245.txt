I get the following exception the first time a sequence diagram is created. 
I&apos;ve tried catching it in the debugger and looking at the context, but didn&apos;t
see anything obvious which would indicate what is causing the problem.

This appears to be the same problem that both Michiel and I reported in comments
to issue 4174 (which has since been closed).
