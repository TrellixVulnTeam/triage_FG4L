Double clicking on a textual annotation of an edge (such as the association
name) places ArgoUML into edit mode on that text.

However if that text is currently blank it is not possible to see where to
double click.

I would like double clicking the edge itself to go to edit mode for the edges
that have some name annotation.

For the association edge I would like this to include editing association end
name by double clicking the line end.
