Switching off multiple adding for a diagram tool by clicking on it does still 
add one more item.

The manual says:
&quot;When (button 1 double click is) used on the tool bar with a tool to add an 
artifact, the selected artifact will be added multiple times to the drawing 
area, once for each further button click, until the tool is again selected or 
another tool chosen.&quot; 

The last part is the problem: If we are in multiple adding mode, then a single 
click on the tool switches back to single adding mode, but we remain in adding 
mode! It would be much more logicat to de-select the tool.
