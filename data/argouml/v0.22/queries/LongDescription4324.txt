Steps to reproduce:

- Create a new project, add a component, save it with name &quot;foo&quot; and extension
&quot;.uml&quot;
- Now, do some changes, and resave the project. The default file name is
&quot;foo.uml&quot; (correct) but the default extension is &quot;.zargo&quot;! If I press &quot;save&quot;, I
get a foo.uml.zargo file. That&apos;s not good.

Maybe we should alreaedy save the chosen extension, or just deduce it from the
file name.

Moreover, the file name gets cancelled when the extension is changed. But I fear
it&apos;s a FileChooserDialog issue...
