In the words of Roy Feldman:

&quot;In order to use AndromMDA as is, you don&apos;t need the ability to modify a 
profile. However, if you want to make any significant extensions or
customizations to the AndroMDA plug-in cartridges, which is something I
am interested in, then you need the ability to modify and extend the
profile.
That includes (...) generalizing DataTypes (...).&quot;

This should be implemented by allowing a DataType to be drawn on the 
diagram, according the notation defined in the UML spec.
