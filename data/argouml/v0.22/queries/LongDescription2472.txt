The keyboard focus (indicated by a blue rectangle) location remains after 
closing the Settings dialog box with the close button in the window border and 
reopening it.

1. Select in the Menu Edit -&gt; Settings... The keyboard focus is initially on 
the Preferences tab.
2. Click on the last checkmark. The keyboard focus is indicated by a blue 
rectangle around this item.
3. Close the dialog box with the close button in the top right corner of the 
window border.
4. Select in the Menu Edit -&gt; Settings... The keyboard focus is now still on 
the last checkbox.
This is wrong; it should be as in 1 above.
5. Close the dialog with the Cancel button.
6. Select in the Menu Edit -&gt; Settings... The keyboard focus is again on the 
Preferences tab.
So, in this case it is OK.
