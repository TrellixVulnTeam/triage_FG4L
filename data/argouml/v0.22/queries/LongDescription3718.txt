If you load the attached model and immediately save it back out again, all the
comments are missing.  It looks like adding the comments to a diagram helps at
least some of them get saved correctly, but I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s the fact that
they are in a diagram or something in the model itself which is changed when
they are manipulated.  I suspect latter.
