Adding a Class with an Association to itself to a Class diagram creates an
invisible edge (with a very helpful critic note attached saying it should be
made more visible).  There doesn&apos;t appear to be any way to resize or move it and
if there&apos;s more than one for a single class the labels overlap so that they are
unreadable.
