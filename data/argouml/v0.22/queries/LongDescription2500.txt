The &quot;Find...&quot; function in the menu or toolbar is designed not to find anything 
that is not on any diagram. It should allow to search the model instead.

Reproduce as follows:
1. Start ArgoUML.
2. Create a class and name it e.g. &quot;Testing&quot;.
5. Select Find in the toolbar.
6. Enter as searchstring &quot;*est*&quot;, and start the search.
This way it works fine.
7. Remove the class from the diagram.
8. Start the search again.
The class is not found.

You have to fill in &quot;In diagram: &lt;searchstring&gt;&quot; to be able to find something, 
so it is obvious to the user that only diagrams are searched.

I do not know (yet) how to change the UI, so that this added functionality is 
available. Any input is welcome!
