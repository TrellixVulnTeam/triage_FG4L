The button in UMLComboBoxNavigator, which is the combobox with a navigation
button at the right, is initially downlighted.

See e.g. on the properties panel of a Statemachine, namespace &amp; context fields.

Once you select something else in the combo, the button is active.

If you select the empty value, e.g. on the Operation field of the Callevent
proppanel, the button remains highlighted - which is also wrong.
