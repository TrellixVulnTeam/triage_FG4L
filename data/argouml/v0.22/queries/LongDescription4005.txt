I am using the Argouml with Andromda extension.
One thing required by Andromda is to assign a controller class as the context of
an activity graph by adding a tag like these, as quote from Andromda&apos;s guide:
-----------
 Add a tagged value to the controller, pointing to the use-case, like this: 
@andromda.presentation.controller.usecase=My UseCase  (the value is the name of
the use-case).
-----------
I noticed with or without setting this tag, the exported xmi file from argouml
has the following tag within the activity tag:
-----------
   &lt;UML:StateMachine.context&gt;
                    &lt;UML:UseCase xmi.idref = &apos;.:0000000000000EB9&apos;/&gt;
   &lt;/UML:StateMachine.context&gt;
--------
where it references the Use Case.
Is there a way to change the context to point to the controller class?
Thanks,
