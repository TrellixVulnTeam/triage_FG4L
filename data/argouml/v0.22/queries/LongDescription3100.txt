After adding a new package, the package is shown in the explorer with a funny 
name: &quot;(anon Package)&quot; or &quot;(anon Class)&quot;. My guess it stands for &quot;anonymous 
package&quot; or &quot;anonymous class&quot;, however this came to me after many hours or 
thinking. I wonder why this cryptic description whas chosen? Why not write the 
whole string, there&apos;s plenty of room.
