The menu-item View-&gt;Notation leading to a list of the supported languages does
not belong in the View menu, since it does set the DEFAULT language, which is
only used for the creation of new projects.

We should retain the possibility to easyly switch the notation language used in
the project, so this menuitem should move into the File menu, preferrably just
above the Properties item.
