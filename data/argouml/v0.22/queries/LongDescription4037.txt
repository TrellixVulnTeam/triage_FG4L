I see ArgoUML taking upwards of 40% of my processor time on some diagrams.
For instance, I have one project in which the two most complicated class
diagrams burn 50% or so of my processor time.

Running the Quartz Debug application, I see that on those two diagrams the
diagram is being entirely repainted constantly. This is not the case on any of
the other diagrams.

I have a big screen (1920x1200), so this takes quite a bit of time.

So I went back to the 0.20 release version, and I don&apos;t see this behavior (in
fact, the CPU load is better even on the other drawings).

I built the CVS version using &quot;build.sh package&quot;, then copied the .jar files to
the proper place inside another copy of the application. It otherwise seems to
work fine.

Examining things further, it is not the complexity that causes this redrawing;
it is the presence of certain Association edges in the current diagram.

In the attached CA3Design.zargo file, you can see this in the &quot;Hardware
Resources&quot; and &quot;Active Objects&quot; class diagrams. 

I have made a simple diagram with one association that triggers this behavior.
Look at the &quot;Redraw Problem Demonstrated&quot; class diagram.

If you open the context menu on the Association and choose
&quot;Navigability/bidirectional&quot; the constant repainting stops.
