Missing label on radiobuttons in Import Sources -&gt; Java

In the &quot;Import Sources&quot; dialog, tab &quot;Java&quot;:
The 2nd radiobutton pair does not have a label, conform to the 1st one.
It should read: &quot;Arrays modelled as&quot;, and the buttons: &quot;Datatypes&quot; 
and &quot;Multiplicity 1..n&quot;.
