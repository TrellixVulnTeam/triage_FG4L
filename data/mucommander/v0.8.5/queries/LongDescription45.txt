"If you drag a file from GNOME (e.g. from Nautilus) to muCommander, it works perfectly: muCommander copies/moves the file to the directory where the file was dropped. But the reverse doesn't work.  Steps: 1) Open a directory in Nautilus (the ""explorer"" in GNOME) 2) Drag a file (e.g. ""foo.txt"" in directory ""/path/to/foo"") from muCommander and drop it in Nautilus with the CTRL key pressed  Expected: In Nautilus, a file ""foo.txt"" is created, with the same size, name and content as the original one.  Real: In Nautilus, a file called ""new file"" is created. Its content is ""/path/to/foo/foo.txt""."
