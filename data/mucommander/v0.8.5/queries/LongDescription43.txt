"This is a Windows only bug, it cannot be reproduced under OS X.  Steps to reproduce: - create a file whose name contains precisely one upper case character, the first one. For example, Test.txt. - rename that file to full lower-case (test.txt) The file will suddenly be detected as shortcut by muCommander. - rename that file again, any name seems to work. The file will disapear (deleted? Moved somewhere?)"
