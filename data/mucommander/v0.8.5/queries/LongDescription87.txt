"Steps to reproduce: - In the location field, enter the path to an archive file supported by muCommander. In my case, the path is /Users/maxence/test.zip - Wait for a couple seconds  Expected behavior: - Nothing happens, no auto-completion suggestion (the path is already complete)  Actual behavior: - The auto-completion suggestion popup appears, suggesting 'test.zip'. When selected, the location field's contents and the same suggestion ('test.zip') appears again.  Additional information: - This happens only with archives, folders are fine. - If the archive path ends with a trailing separator (/Users/maxence/test.zip), the behavior is OK: the auto-completion popup suggests folders located inside the archive."
