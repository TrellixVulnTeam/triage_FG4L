"Steps to reproduce: - Create a folder whose name contains a period (e.g. ""test.dir""). - Trigger the rename functionality (F6)  Expected behaviour: - the whole name is selected.  Observed behaviour: - the selection stops at the period  While this behaviour is perfect for files, it makes little sense for directories.  Note that we might want to keep this behaviour for special folders, such as muCommander.app (folder, but should be considered as a file). See #158 for a semi-related issue."
