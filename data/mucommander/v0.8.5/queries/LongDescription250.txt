"=== Steps to reproduce ===  * Select (highlight) a file that is not the first one in the current folder.  * Let the refresh action's key (F9 by default) pressed.  === Expected behavior === The currently selected file remains the same while the folder is being refreshed.  === Actual behavior === After a while, the currently selected file changes, 'jumping' from one file to the other.  This issue can be reproduced in 0.8.3 and current nightly."
