"0.8.1 (and current nightly) has two issues with the 'Swap folders' functionality. The first one is the most critical one as it can cause the renaming of unwanted files. Here are the steps to reproduce both issues :  1)  - On the right panel, swap the order of the Name and Extension columns, making the Name column appear before the Extension one - Swap folders - Rename a file in the right panel by clicking on the name cell, changing its name and validating by pressing enter  Expected result : the file selected in the RIGHT panel is renamed with the new name entered Actual result : a file in the LEFT panel-áis renamed with the new name entered  2) - On the right panel, hide all columns so that only the Name column remains - Swap folders  Expected result : folders are swapped Actual result : muCommander crashes, leaving the main window unpainted (cf attached screenshot)  Note that these 2 issues have been grouped into a single bug because the underlying cause is the same."
