"* The space bar does not select files anymore, but muCommander searches for files with a space in the name. * After typing a few letters, the cursor jumps to the correct file, but hitting enter does not open the file / folder until a few seconds have elapsed, and the 'search as you type' mode is switched back off.  Before, space selected files, and I could hit enter right after a search which made it possible to browse the file system very quickly."
