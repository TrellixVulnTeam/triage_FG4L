"=== Steps to reproduce ===  * Have an `action_keymap.xml` file containing the following line: {{{ #!xml <action class=""com.mucommander.ui.action.impl.PermanentDeleteAction"" keystroke=""F8"" alt_keystroke=""DELETE""/> }}}  * start muCommander as a .app (OS X)  * try to delete a file using `F8`  === Expected behaviour === The `PermanentDeleteAction` is triggered.  === Observed behaviour === The `DeleteAction` is triggered.  === Additional Notes ===  * looking in the keyboard shortcut editor, I can see that both actions are mapped to `F8` and `BACKSPACE`.  * starting muCommander from the command line (`java -jar`) yields the expected behaviour, but the keyboard shortcut editor still contains the `F8` / `BACKSPACE` conflict."
