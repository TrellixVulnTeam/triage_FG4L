"Under Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), transferring files from and/or to an SFTP server causes the JVM to leak memory fast, leaking approximately the same amount of memory as the data transferred. This memory is never recovered, even if the garbage collector is called explicitly (System.gc()).  Steps to reproduce: - Launch muCommander under Mac OS X 10.4 with Java 1.5 - Copy a file from an SFTP server to a local volume (or vice-versa) - Using top or Activity Viewer.app, watch the memory usage grow and never go down as the transfer progresses  Additional information: - this happens with Java 1.5 and Java 1.6 DP but not with Java 1.4 - this bug cannot be reproduced under the newer Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) - this bug cannot be reproduced under Windows XP - transfers with protocols other than SFTP (FTP, SMB, ...) do not cause this problem"
