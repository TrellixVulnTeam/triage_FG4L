"If the user clicks on file ‘A’ in the file table, and then clicks on file ‘B’ soon enough, the second click will be treated as a double click on file ‘B’, which launches / opens ‘B’.  Expected: to move the selection bar to file ‘B’ without opening it.  Similarly, if the ‘..’ item is double clicked, in the parent folder a single click on the ‘..’ item will be treated as a double click and will take the user to the parent folder. This leads to unwanted folder changes.  Consider: two double clicks on ‘..’ should take the user up two levels. Instead, it takes them up three levels."
