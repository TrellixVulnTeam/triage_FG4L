"The Java version number displayed in the About dialog is using the `java.vm.version` property rather than `java.version`.  While most VMs have a meaningful version number (e.g. 1.5.07b), the latest Apple 1.6 VM has 14.1, which is confusing.  We should either use `java.version` instead of `java.vm.version`, or use both."
