"Steps to reproduce: - Press any of the main menu mnemonics (alt-f to open the File menu if muCommander is configured to use English, for example)  Expected behaviour: The correct menu opens  Observed behaviour: The keypress is used as a quicksearch item rather than a menu mnemonic. Note that pressing alt, releasing it and then pressing the F key will open the File menu. It's only using both keys at the same time that dispatches the event to the wrong component."
