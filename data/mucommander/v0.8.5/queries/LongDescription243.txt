"Since Java for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 4, viewer/editor menus don't appear, except for the 'File' one.  Steps to reproduce:  - View (F3) or Edit (F4) a text file (also applies to images).  Expected behavior:  - File and Edit menus appear in the menu bar.  Actual behavior:  - Only the File menu appears, Edit menu doesn't.  Additional notes:  - Cmd+Tab to another application and back to muCommander refreshes the menu bar and causes the Edit menu to appear.  - This bug is caused by JMenuBar not refreshing the menu after it has first been displayed. This is a regression introduced by Java for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 4 (also in Update 5 Developer Preview).  - The bug is reproducible in muCommander 0.8.4 nightly and 0.8.3, and probably in earlier versions as well.
