"=== Steps to reproduce ===  * create an archive (eg `test.zip`).  * open `test.zip` in the right panel, any other folder containing plain files in the left panel  * pack (create a new archive, not copy) a file from the left panel into the right panel  === Expected behaviour === A new archive is correctly created.  === Observed behaviour === The ""Packing file"" dialog stalls forever.  However, once this dialog is manually closed, the new archive was properly created."
