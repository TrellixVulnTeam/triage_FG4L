"Currently, the Unicode byte-order mark (BOM) receives no special treatment and is thus considered as an editable character by the text editor.   Therefore, files encoded in UTF-8/16/32 with a leading byte-order mark (BOM) will start with an invisible character in the editor, as evidenced by the caret (the right-arrow needs to be pressed twice to move past the first real character).  To prevent this artifact from occurring, the Unicode BOM should not be considered as an editable character."
