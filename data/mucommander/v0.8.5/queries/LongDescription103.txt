"I have some mountpoints on my system (/boot /usr/portage /var/tmp/ccache) which appear all in the drive button list (even if i never need them in the list).   With the attached patch you can create a new configuration entry like     <excludeMountPoints>/usr/portage,/boot,/var/tmp/ccache</excludeMountPoints> and the mount points are not populated to the drive list."
