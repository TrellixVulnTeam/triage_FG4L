"No matter whether I see hidden files in a file listing or not, in the (directory) tree view the hidden dirs (starting with a dot) are always shown. Please don't show these directories when the ""hidden"" files are hidden in the corresponding file listing. There should be one shortcut for switching both preferences at the same time."
