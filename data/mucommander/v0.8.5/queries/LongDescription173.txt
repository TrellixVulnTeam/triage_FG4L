"Steps to reproduce: - Store new, valid credentials for a remote account - Change the password of the account you're using - Try to connect again using muCommander, making sure to change the password and to leave ""Store login & password"" checked.  Expected behaviour: - The connection should be successful, and after restarting muCommander it should remember the new credentials  Observed behaviour: - muCommander will sometime connect, but forget to overwrite its expired credentials  A proper scenario to trigger the bug 100% is yet to be identified."
