"Hey Maxence,  When we type in the LocationTextField a non existed (but not malformed) path, we get an error dialog and then the text in the text-field is selected and the text-field gets the focus. When we type in the LocationTextField name of bookmark with non existed (but not malformed) location, there is a different outcome - after the error dialog appears, the text in the text-field is not selected and the focus is at the file-table. It seems that the outcome of the 2 cases above should be the same - In both cases a non existed location (again, not malformed) was entered in the LocationTextField, and the first outcome is the desired one."
