"Using a different color for the shortcuts that have been changed from the default values in the shortcuts editor would allow to immediately spot all the actions that have been edited.  My feeling is that most people only edit a few shortcuts, and want to easily find the ones they have changed. It will become particularly useful when we have a 'Restore default' button that restores the default shortcuts for the currently selected action.  The current theme's 'symbolic link' (or alternatively 'marked file') foreground color could be used as the font color for customized actions."
