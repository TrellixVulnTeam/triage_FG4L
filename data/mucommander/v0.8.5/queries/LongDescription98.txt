"I have a zip file of a game (TWTPB), which muCommander opens OK, but muCommander displays all files in the archive as being in the root of the archive. There are, in fact, two directories within the archive which are not being picked up. As a result, unpacking with muCommander causes the game to abort operation before really even starting up.  Using another archive utility (jZip), the folders are recognised and unpackage correctly. muCommander doesn't *normally* do this -- I have other zip files which work OK.  If you can't get a copy of the problematic archive from the TWTPB project page (http://www.spellofplay.com/games/twtpb/download), please let me know -- I can email a copy to anyone interested (it's an 8meg archive)."
