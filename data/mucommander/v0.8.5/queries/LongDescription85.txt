"Steps to reproduce : - Enable the tree view on the left panel - Quit muCommander (the tree view setting is persisted in the preference file) - Start muCommander  Expected behavior : - muCommander starts normally  Actual behavior : - the application fails to start properly: the left panel is not painted and UI is totally unresponsive  Additional information: - both startup folders are local folders, which means that the error is not caused by a stalled network filesystem. - this bug has been reproduced with the current SVN trunk running on Mac OS X 10.5 with Java 1.6.  I have generated a full stack trace that confirms the presence of a deadlock and shows where it occurs, I'm attaching it to this bug.  This deadlock does not happen all the time but to give you an idea of the frequency, out of 10 launches the deadlock occurred twice. So I'm able to reproduce it relatively quickly and deterministically, which should help to validate the fix."
