"I have a problem with the lastest build (dated 2008/05/05). Double click (with mouse) does not seem to be working as what I will expect (i.e., change directory if I clicked on directory name; launch the program if I clicked on an executable; ... etc).  Additional information: 1. Double-click sometimes (not always) triggered the ""Rename selected File"" function (similar to Shift+F6). 2. I can change folder or launch applications by Right-click + Open. But I cannot do this by double-click on selected folder/file.  p.s. The same problem happened on previous builds as well.  ------------------- Version information  muCommander Version: 0.8.3 Build date: 2008/05/05  Java VM Name: Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM Version: 10.0-b19 Vendor: Sun Microsystems Inc.
