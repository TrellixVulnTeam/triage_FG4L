"Steps to reproduce: 1. I have only seen this with 'Adobe Illustrator Documents' (CS3 version). All files have .ai extensions. It does not happen all the time, but 90% of the cases. 2. I copy the file(s) to some other folder. 3. The Finder's get info dialog shows the file kind has changed to 'Image'. The file doesn't open in Illustrator on native open, and the file icon changes.  Expected behaviour: The file kind to stay the same.  PS: thank you for this great application!"
