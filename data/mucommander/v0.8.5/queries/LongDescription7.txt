"Steps to reproduce: Enter a valid UNC path in the location bar. The path must point to a existing, non-empty directory.  Expected behaviour: The content of the specified directory should be properly listed.  Observed behaviour: - All files are displayed as symlinks. - All directories are displayed as files and as symlinks. - Some files don't have icons at all. The only example of that was the muCommander 0.8.2 Windows setup file."
