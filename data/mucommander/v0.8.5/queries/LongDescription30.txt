"Steps to reproduce: - create a Zip file , say '~/test.zip', that contains a somewhat large file. - mark a somewhat small file and pack it ('File' -> 'Pack files...' menu item) into the same Zip file, i.e. '~/test.zip'. - when the file collision dialog appears, warning that the file already exists in the destination, choose 'Overwrite'.  Expected result : => the new Zip file contains the 'somewhat small file', and the archive file is smaller than the previous one.  Actual result : => when entered with muCommander, the new Zip file still contains the old 'somewhat large' file and has the same size as the previous one. Futhermore, the new Zip is corrupted: running 'unzip -vt' will reveal errors in the Zip file.  Note: if the new Zip file is larger than the existing one, everything is fine (no bug)."
