"I use alt-1 for left drive selection and alt-2 for right-drive selection. It's worked for ages but doesn't work in the latest nightly build I downloaded about 15 minutes ago.  I've also noticed that action_keymap.xml now has the word ""pressed"" in all of the hotkeys? Does this make a difference? (Removing and re-adding didn't seem to change how my left/right drive selectors don't work)"
