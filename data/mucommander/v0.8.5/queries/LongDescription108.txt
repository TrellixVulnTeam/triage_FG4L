"If I start up mucommander like this:  mucommand.sh sftp://my.host  ... first, the title screen covers up the login box.  If I move to the login box and enter a username and password, the login fails even though I'm using the correct username and password.  If I start it up, and go to the same sftp host, my username and password works.  Thanks for a great tool."
