"The path checking in Ctrl+G (and some other places) is too restrictive.  It accepts only paths of the form c:\some\dir.  While, in Windows, c:/some/dir is a valid path as well.  Also valid paths are ""\some\dir"" (relative to the root of the current drive), ""../some/dir"" (relative to the current directory).  I'd expect all these variants to work with Ctrl+G and in Shell window."
