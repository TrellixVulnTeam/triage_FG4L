"Hello. We use an internal (linux) server for file transfers. I can sftp there by using WinScp and without giving any directory/path option, I arrive to my home folder (/home/project). Unfortunately muCommander enters in any case a ""/"" sign, so I land in the root directory, where I don't have permission to list the content (permission for ""others"": --x). Even if I enter the correct path (where I'm allowed to go through, I just don't have the permission to list the content, until I arrive in my home directory), muCommander don't succed and reports ""URL contains an invalid port"". Most probably as it tries to list the content.  The same problem is present under OSX, so it's not a windows problem, but I don't know how far JAVA runtime libraries are the same. My Windows library is version is 6 Update 11, those of my mac is Java for Mac OSX 10.5 Update 3.  The situation is the same with v0.8.3.  I hope that you can easily find the bug. I enjoy this cross-platform file manager, I hope so much that I don't have to use different browsers for local and sftp folders.  Thank you for your efforts and best regards, Ferenc"
