"Abstract : Folder icons may spin endlessly in the tree view if they cannot be fetched because of an I/O error.  Steps to reproduce : - Enable the Tree view on one of the panels - From the panel with the Tree view enabled, change the location to ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg  - When asked for credentials, choose 'Anonymous' user  Expected behavior : - The Tree view is updated with the new location and all its parent folders (tree nodes) are expanded.  Actual behavior : - One of the parent folders (usually /pub) cannot be expanded - the spinning dial icon spins endlessly (see attached screenshot).  Additional information: - The debug output indicates that the folder failed to be listed (exception in FTPFile.ls()) because of the following FTP server error ""530 Sorry, the maximum number of clients (3) from your host are already connected."". This means that 3 concurrent threads were already accessing the FTP server (each with its own connection) when the ls() attempt was made. - The bug can be reproduced most of the time but not always. It shouldn't take more than 2 or 3 attempts to reproduce it. - This was reproduced under Mac OS X 10.5 with Java 1.6 but I don't think this is relevant.  I see two separate issues that would need to be addressed:  1) The folder listing should fail gracefully, whatever the reason of the failure is. The folder icon should probably be changed to one that symbolizes the failure: CustomFileIconProvider.NOT_ACCESSIBLE_FILE might be a good fit.  2) It seems that the tree spawns 4 threads (or more). We should reduce the number of concurrent threads and serialize some of the I/O operations made by the tree to play nice with protocols such as FTP."
