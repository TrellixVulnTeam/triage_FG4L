"I just came to think about how the free space indicator looks, and I think that it is turned around compared to what's normal.  Normally I would think of the bar being the amount of space used on the drive, since it would then ""fill up"" the bar when you fill up the drive. Is this just me?  Also, it would be cool if the bar gradually changed color, when more space was used on the drive, so it would have an orange color at, say, 90% used, and a red color when it's more than 95% used."
