"I created a file associations.xml as described in the forum. After the first launch of muC 0.8.3 (wasn't available in the Bugzilla list) everything worked fine.  Then I checked back the file associations.xml and found some autogenerated content:     <association command=""openEXE"">         <filename value=""[^.]+""/>     </association>  After some more launches I had several identical blocks like the above at the beginning of my associations.xml. To me that looks like a small bug."
