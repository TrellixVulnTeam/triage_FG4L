"When the main window isn't large enough, elements of the toolbar aren't displayed.  This isn't terribly important, but is somewhat incoherent with the command bar behaviour which resizes its components to fit the window.  A clever solution would be to ""wrap"" the toolbar on more than one line if one isn't sufficient to display it."
