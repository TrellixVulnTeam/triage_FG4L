"Hi.  I have nothing agaist the design of the splash screen. It's neat. But splash screens annoy me in general: they hover on top of the window you want to work in just to show that, yes, the program whose symbol you just clicked, does indeed start up. And I have found that often the splash screens slow down start-up. With muCommander my impression is that start-up is almost twice as fast without splash, even on a dual-core AMD (2 GHz) with 2 Gigs of RAM. Now, I found the forum post that told me to add the --no-splash as a start-up parameter. On Linux, you have to be root to do that (considering muCommander has been installed systemwide by root; the startup script is in /usr/share/mucommander/). Hmmm. Also, for Windows, I will have to check on Monday and edit the respective setting. Not really userfriendly towards the average GUI user. If possible, it would be great if you could add a ""[ ] show splash screen at start-up"" checkbox somewhere in the Preferences dialogue (by the way: German translation may be: ""[ ] zeige Startbild"" -- even better (and simpler) would be a check box ON the start-up screen ""[ ] don't show this again"" ...  Best regards  Andreas"
