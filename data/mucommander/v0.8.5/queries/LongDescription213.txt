"The icon used for online documentation on OS X (`help_mac.png`) is 19x20, as opposed to all other icons which are 16x16.  This in itself is not a big issue, but causes some visual bugs depending on where they are used.  For example: === Steps to reproduce ===  * Assuming `SHIFT` is used as the command bar's ""modifier key"", add an online documentation that's only displayed on `SHIFT`.  * Press `SHIFT`  === Expected behaviour === The Online Documentation button appears without changing the command bar's layout.  === Observed behaviour === Both the command bar and the status bar shift up by a couple of pixels, as `help_mac.png` doesn't fit in the default button height."
