"Created an attachment (id=53) ugly ClassFinder patch  I recently moved to nightly build and since then I can't import L&F libraries. L&F works if I copy the library to ~/.mucommander/export, but the import dialog doesn't work.  The first error is that the ClassFinder can't find classes inside a jar file using the relative path as a package name. I fix that using this ugly patch:          if (browsable instanceof ZipArchiveFile) {             return find("""", browsable);         } else {             return find(relativePath.replace(browsable.getSeparator(), "".""), browsable);         }   But after that new errors appear, mostly: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException I think they are related to the JComboBox's index issue, but I haven't had the time to take a closer look."
