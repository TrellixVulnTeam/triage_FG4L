"Toggling the ""'''Round displayed file sizes'''"" checkbox in the ""'''Folder'''"" section of the preferences does sometimes not behave correctly, that is, even if the checkbox is marked, the file sizes are not displayed as rounded values and vice versa. Sometimes it works correctly, sometimes not. Just play around toggling the checkbox and watch the folder view. The behaviour is reproducable!"
