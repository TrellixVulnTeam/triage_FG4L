"Steps to reproduce: - Resize the main window to make its width as small as possible. - Increase the main window's width again.  Expected behaviour: - the folder panel's separator should stay in the position it was initially (usually 50% of the main window)  Observed behaviour: - the folder panel's separator gets pushed to the far right of the window  I fixed an issue very similar to that one ages ago which had to do with the way resize events were handled - the position of the separator was calculated at the ""wrong"" time and was sometimes set to 0. Maybe it's another symptom of this issue and I didn't fix it as well as I thought I had. "
