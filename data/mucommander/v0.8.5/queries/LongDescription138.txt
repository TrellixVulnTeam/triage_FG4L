"If the /etc/fstab contains multiple mountpoints with the same directory name, the DrivePopupButton contains multiple entries with the same name (but different shortcuts).  For example: i have a mountpoint ""/data/"" and ""/storage/data/"". The list contains ""data"" twice, one with ""d"" as shortcut, and one with ""a"".  Maybe the full path should be added to the list if the name is not unique."
