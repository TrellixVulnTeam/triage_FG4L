"=== Steps to reproduce ===   * Delete muCommander preferences folder (make a backup copy of it first:)  * Start muCommander 0.8.3 and quit  * Start muCommander 0.8.4 (current nightly)  === Issues ===  1) 101 log warnings are displayed on startup (one for each action it seems), here are the first ten: {{{      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.924] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: alt 1 canceling mapping to ShowParentFoldersQL      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.925] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: alt 2 canceling mapping to ShowRecentLocationsQL      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.926] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: alt 3 canceling mapping to ShowRecentExecutedFil$      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.927] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: alt 4 canceling mapping to ShowBookmarksQL      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.927] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: control B canceling mapping to AddBookmark      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.927] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: control G canceling mapping to ChangeLocation      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.929] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: F10 canceling mapping to CloseWindow      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.929] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,117 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: meta W canceling mapping to CloseWindow      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.929] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: control M canceling mapping to CompareFolders      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.930] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: control K canceling mapping to ConnectToServer }}}  2) If you quit 0.8.4 and take a look at the `action_keymap.xml`, you'll notice there is one action there (!OpenInOtherPanel), even though no action was ever customized: {{{ <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?> <!-- See http://trac.mucommander.com/wiki/ActionKeyMap for information on how to customize this file --> <keymap version=""0.8.4"">     <action id=""OpenInOtherPanel"" keystroke=""ctrl ENTER""/> </keymap> }}}  3) If you take a look at `command_bar.xml` (again after quitting 0.8.4), you'll notice actions are still referenced using the action class path and not the action Id : {{{ <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?> <command_bar modifier=""SHIFT"">     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.ViewAction""/>     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.EditAction""/>     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.CopyAction"" alt_action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.LocalCopyAction""/>     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.MoveAction"" alt_action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.RenameAction""/>     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.MkdirAction"" alt_action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.MkfileAction""/>     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.DeleteAction"" alt_action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.PermanentDeleteAction""/>     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.RefreshAction""/>     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.CloseWindowAction""/> </command_bar> }}}  => I guess the file would have been updated to the new 0.8.4 format if changes were made to the command bar using the command bar editor. I suggest we toggle the 'dirty' flag after the import, so the file is written to the new 0.8.4 format upon application exit.   4) Same for `toolbar.xml`. "
