"When you press Alt-Tab like this: press Alt, press Tab, release Alt, release Tab,---muCommander's main menu is activated before windows are switched. Therefore when you return to muCommander and try to operate file panes you find yourself browsing main menu instead.  This prevents smooth workflow so I really hope this can be fixed.  Also tried to install jre6 update 10 (VM version 11.0-b15)---the problem stays there."
