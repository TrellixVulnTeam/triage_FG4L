"Hey,  When there are no elements at the combobox (after ""clear history"" action, for example), openning the popup of the combobox throws the following exception: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: setSelectedIndex: 0 out of bounds  You should probably add the check ""if (getItemCount() > 0)"" before the ""setSelectedIndex(0)"" is made at the ""popupMenuWillBecomeVisible"" function.
