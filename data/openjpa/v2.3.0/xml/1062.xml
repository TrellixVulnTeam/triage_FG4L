                            <comment id="12710920" author="clr" created="Tue, 19 May 2009 23:24:22 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Are you sure the scope settings are wrong in openjpa-jdbc/pom.xml? What is the compile-time dependency on postgresql, ant, and hsqldb?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar question on openjpa-lib/pom.xml ant and log4j dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar question on openjpa-kernel/pom.xml ant and websphere dependency.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12711118" author="drwoods" created="Wed, 20 May 2009 13:31:45 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to review, which was why I attached the patch instead of just committing it.  All the junit tests passed and I could have read the dependencies wrong, but here is what I based the changes on -&lt;br/&gt;
By marking &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;compile&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;, then those dependencies are only used at compile time and are not included as maven transitive dependencies, which helps maven-bundle-plugin create more accurate bundle metadata.  If you look at the openjpa/pom.xml and openpa-all/pom.xml, the list of dependencies in there are the true runtime dependencies (minus any Derby/JDBC drivers.)&lt;br/&gt;
openjpa-lib - Log4J is optional, as there are LogFactoryAdapter impls for Log4J, Commons-logging and No logging.&lt;br/&gt;
openjpa-kernel - WebSphere jars are only for compile time of WAS container integration support and are not included in the binary distribution.&lt;br/&gt;
openjpa-jdbc - Postgresql and Hsqldb are only compile time depends for the PostgresqlDictionary and HSQLDictionary classes, which must be provided at runtime by the user/app supplying the required JDBC driver.  Ant is only needed when calling the enhancer or reverse mapping tool from Ant.&lt;br/&gt;
I still want a couple more eyes to look at this (like maybe Mike) and I want to run some more tests before committing.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12711198" author="drwoods" created="Wed, 20 May 2009 16:52:33 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Updated patch that only adds the bundle metadata to openjpa.jar and doesn&apos;t change any of the dependency scopes, but does add one missing openjpa.jar dependency on openjpa-slice.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12711253" author="clr" created="Wed, 20 May 2009 18:42:57 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; By marking &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;compile&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;, then those dependencies are only used at compile time and are not included as maven transitive dependencies, which helps maven-bundle-plugin create more accurate bundle metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My understanding is different. I understand that if you have a compile-time dependency, then it&apos;s a permanent dependency that carries through test, integration, and runtime. But I&apos;m not a maven expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; openjpa-lib - Log4J is optional, as there are LogFactoryAdapter impls for Log4J, Commons-logging and No logging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you have a requirement that might be needed at runtime (e.g. log4j) and you can compile without it, it should be marked as provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Ant is only needed when calling the enhancer or reverse mapping tool from Ant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ant should be a test dependency or a provided dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; openjpa-jdbc - Postgresql and Hsqldb are only compile time depends for the PostgresqlDictionary and HSQLDictionary classes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is interesting. These are open source libraries so there&apos;s no harm in including them. It just struck me as odd that we would have a hard dependency on these database-specific libraries, but upon reflection, I think you&apos;re right to include them as compile dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I still want a couple more eyes to look at this (like maybe Mike) and I want to run some more tests before committing.&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="12711390" author="mikedd" created="Wed, 20 May 2009 23:08:27 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; By marking &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;compile&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;, then those dependencies are only used at compile time and are not included as maven &amp;gt;&amp;gt;transitive dependencies, which helps maven-bundle-plugin create more accurate bundle metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;My understanding is different. I understand that if you have a compile-time dependency, then it&apos;s a permanent dependency that carries &amp;gt;through test, integration, and runtime. But I&apos;m not a maven expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s my understanding as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compile is the heaviest dependency type and will carry through all phases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provided is similar to compile but the jar won&apos;t included in any artifacts downstream. It will be passed along as a transitive &apos;provided&apos; dependency though. This scope used for things that you compile against but don&apos;t want to redistribute (ie something that is part of the JDK, or the WebSphere UOW API - which is only used with WebSphere). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not a OSGi bundling expert, but I&apos;d expect the maven-bundle-plugin to ignore &apos;provided&apos; dependencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; openjpa-lib - Log4J is optional, as there are LogFactoryAdapter impls for Log4J, Commons-logging and No logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; So if you have a requirement that might be needed at runtime (e.g. log4j) and you can compile without it, it should be marked as &amp;gt;provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we don&apos;t need a component at compile time but is required at runtime then the scope should be runtime. If it&apos;s optional at runtime then it should be test (if tests need it) or not included at all. I think log4j fits the latter category, I&apos;d have to check though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ant is only needed when calling the enhancer or reverse mapping tool from Ant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;So ant should be a test dependency or a provided dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+1 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; openjpa-jdbc - Postgresql and Hsqldb are only compile time depends for the PostgresqlDictionary and HSQLDictionary classes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;This is interesting. These are open source libraries so there&apos;s no harm in including them. It just struck me as odd that we would have a &amp;gt;hard dependency on these database-specific libraries, but upon reflection, I think you&apos;re right to include them as compile dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think these are really &apos;provided&apos; dependencies we &lt;b&gt;should&lt;/b&gt; only instantiate the dictionaries if we&apos;re going to connect to PostgreSQL or HSQL and I&apos;d rather not redistribute them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I still want a couple more eyes to look at this (like maybe Mike) and I want to run some more tests before committing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;+1 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch you committed looks good, but the scoping looks mostly correct as is (exception for log4j). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What sort of tests are you running to verify the resultant bundle (forgive me if this is in another JIRA - haven&apos;t checked as close as I should)? Are there any problems that occur with &apos;provided&apos; dependencies, but don&apos;t with &apos;compile&apos; ones? &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12711601" author="drwoods" created="Thu, 21 May 2009 13:46:53 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; By marking &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;compile&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;, then those dependencies are only used at compile time and are not included as maven &amp;gt;&amp;gt;transitive dependencies, which helps maven-bundle-plugin create more accurate bundle metadata.&lt;br/&gt;

&amp;gt; I&apos;m not a OSGi bundling expert, but I&apos;d expect the maven-bundle-plugin to ignore &apos;provided&apos; dependencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the m-b-p is using code dependencies (package imports) over maven scopes, so I ended up having to mark the optional/provided dependencies as do not import.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; openjpa-lib - Log4J is optional, as there are LogFactoryAdapter impls for Log4J, Commons-logging and No logging.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; &lt;br/&gt;

&amp;gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;log4j is required at compile time but optional at runtime, so I&apos;ll update it to provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ant is only needed when calling the enhancer or reverse mapping tool from Ant.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So ant should be a test dependency or a provided dependency.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; +1 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ant is already marked as provided, so no changes needed there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; openjpa-jdbc - Postgresql and Hsqldb are only compile time depends for the PostgresqlDictionary and HSQLDictionary classes&lt;br/&gt;

&amp;gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been using visual inspection of the created MANIFEST.MF, along with install/start the bundle in Apache Felix, to see which bundle dependencies are being marked as required imports versus what we expect at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reviewing and helping with the scope settings.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s unfortunate, might be a bug in m-b-p or at least mentioning to them.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could we roll some validation with Apache Felix into the openjpa-integration module, or would the new openjpa-all be the right place? &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Already working on it, as a new openjpa-integration/osgi-itest module.  Taking longer than expected, due to the complex setup required to run junits using Felix, but I&apos;m close....&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Given that the examples are user visible artifacts &amp;#8211; have these actions been discussed before being implemented?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12713621" author="clr" created="Wed, 27 May 2009 17:07:12 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; This change has modified OpenJPA examples to bring in OSGi dependency. Building examples now requires felix. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no objection to packaging the examples using Felix. But I do agree with Pinaki and object to modifying the simple example to depend on Felix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest a new example program that shows how to integrate Felix if users want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I&apos;m backing out the changes from openjpa-example and will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENJPA-1101&quot; title=&quot;OSGi Integration tests&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;OPENJPA-1101&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;OPENJPA-1101&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to create a OSGi exmaple for integration testing.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
