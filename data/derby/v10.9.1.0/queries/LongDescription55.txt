The Derby documentation http://incubator.apache.org/derby/manuals/admin/hubprnt22.html says:

Derby provides script files for setting the class path, located in $DERBY_INSTALL\frameworks\NetworkServer\bin.

setNetworkClientCP.bat (Windows)
setNetworkClientCP.ksh (UNIX)
setNetworkServerCP.bat (Windows)
setNetworkServerCP.ksh (UNIX)

These files do not exist in Derby.
