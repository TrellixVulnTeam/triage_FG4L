Feature Request:
A system function that lists internal diagnostic information:


	A list of all Derby properties with their actual values.




	The size and usage of the page cache.




	Location of the system directory, temp directories, log file, ....




	The names and state of all open databases.




	A list of the active sessions, transactions, etc.



etc.

Reason: I find it difficult to control the effect of setting Derby properties, e.g. "derby.storage.pageCacheSize".
