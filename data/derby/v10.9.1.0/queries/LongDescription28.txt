Opening this bug on behalf of Mamta Satoor.

------------------------------------------------------
Execute/Create/Drop statement is not supported anymore in 
Derby but we do have internal sps in the database. 
When I try to do say execute statement sysibm.getTableTypes;
I get 2 exceptions

Drop statement behaves more gracefully
ij> drop statement sysibm.getTableTypes;
ERROR 42X62: 'DROP STATEMENT' is not allowed in the 'SYSIBM' 
schema.
