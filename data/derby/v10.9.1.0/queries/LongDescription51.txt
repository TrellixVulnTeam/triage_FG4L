In an applcation server environment where both Network Server 
and Embedded connections are being used it is a problem when 
Network server is shutdown and deregisters the embedded driver 
and shutsdown the databases.


this would be the signature
/**

	Shutdown a Network Server.
	Shuts down the Network Server listening on the port and InetAddress
	specified in the constructor for this NetworkServerControl object.
*
	@param derbyShutdown if true, shutsdown the derby embedded system . if false do not shutdown derby embeddded system
	@exception Exception	throws an exception if an error occurs
*/
public void shutdown(boolean derbyShutdown) throws Exception
