Since the format of the documentation is a recurring theme, this issue should be tracked in JIRA.

Summary of requirements from a user's perspective:


	Provide manuals in a PDF format (one manual per PDF file, not PDF files for every page, see mail thread in derby-dev below)
	Improve navigation in HTML format.  For example, have left hand frame with table of contents and less pages to navigate (see mail thread in derby-user below)
	Provide hyperlinks across manuals
	Make it easier to search the manual (on the user's PC, not refering to the Google search on the Derby web site).  PDFs will address this.  Having less HTML pages would also help here.
