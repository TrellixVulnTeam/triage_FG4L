Tests whether the first operand is between the second and third operands. The second operand must be less than the third operand. Applicable only to types to which <= and >= can be applied. WHERE booking_date BETWEEN DATE'1998-02-26' AND DATE'1998-03-01'

Syntax does not work. DATE'1998-02-26' i think is wrong.

WHERE booking_date BETWEEN '1998-02-26' AND '1998-03-01'

seems to work.
