The section in the developer guide about loading classes from a database, incorrectly discusses loading classes stored in a jar file installed in a database being loaded from a user application. E.g. 'In an embedded environment, when application logic is stored in the database, both the user application and Derby can access classes loaded by the Derby class loader from stored jar files.'
Classes stored in such a jar file can only be used by SQL functions and procedures.
Same section also incorrectly mentions server side methods and object suppport.
