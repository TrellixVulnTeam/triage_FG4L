In a number of places, the Derby documentation points users to the IBM DB2 JDBC Universal Driver and in a number of places uses the words "free download".  

It is true that the "download" is free, but what is not obvious on the Derby or IBM web pages is that the free license for the IBM DB2 JDBC Universal Driver (downloaded via the links in the Derby documentation) restricts use to a Home/Portable Computer (refer to the Lic_en.txt file that accompanies the driver).


	
	
		This rules out use of the driver (without paying a license fee to IBM) on servers or on your company desktop. **
	
	



I suggest that the Derby documentation be updated wherever it provides a link to the IBM DB2 JDBC Universal Driver, to mention that the license accompanying the free download has some usage restrictions.

Some of the pages that reference the driver are:
