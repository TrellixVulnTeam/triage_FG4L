The dblook options dococumentation is incorrect on page http://incubator.apache.org/derby/manuals/tools/tools108.html.


	In the doco, the option below the '-t' option is 'dblook'.  This seems to be a formatting error, as the text for the option describes it as a statement delimiter.




	The dblook code has a -td option that is not documented and looks like it should replace the 'dblook' option shown in the previous point.
