A table synonym is an alternative name for a table or a view. A table or view can be referred to in an SQL statement by its name or by its synonym. A synonym can be created even if the object does not exist. Synonyms refer to a table, view, or another synonym within the same database.

The effect of using a synonym in an SQL statement is similar to that of text substitution. Synonym, which must be defined by the time that an SQL statement is compiled, is replaced at statement compilation time by the qualified base table or view name.

Two new SQL statements will be added to Derby, CREATE SYNONYM and DROP SYNONYM.

CREATE SYNONYM DEPARTMENT.A1 FOR SALES.T1

DROP SYNONYM DEPARTMENT.AI

Databases like Oracle, DB2 and mySQL have this capability and it would be nice to add this to Derby. The syntax conforms to latest SQL standard.
