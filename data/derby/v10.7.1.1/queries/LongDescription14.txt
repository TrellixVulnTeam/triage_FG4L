Opening this bug on behalf of Jack Klebanoff.

---------------------------------------------------------
If a trigger is created with

CREATE TRIGGER T ... VALUES( fn())

The function fn is not called even if the trigger event 
happens. Side effects of the function will not happen.

Derby does not allow CALL statements in trigger actions. 
In Derby, one has to use a VALUES statement and depend on function side effects.
