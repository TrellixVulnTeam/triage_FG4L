Reporting for Daniel John Debrunner.

A static method calls commit() with the nested connection and 
then returns a value to the outer statement. Processing this 
result set incorrectly hits a XCL16 exception. Logically the 
result set is created after the commit, since the value is 
returned after the commit.
