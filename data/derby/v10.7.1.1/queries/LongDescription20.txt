Reporting for Daniel John Debrunner.

If a string contains control characters in the regions matched 
by wild card characters then in some situations a LIKE will 
return false instead of true and the row will not be returned.

Caused by the dynamic like optimization using >= with a prefix 
which is is equivalent to >= on the prefeix appended with 
blanks and not null (\u0000) characters.
