Opening this bug on behalf of Katherine Marsden

--------------------------------------------------------------
JCC cannot guarantee that the CRRTKN that they send is unique 
because it may come from many jvms.

According to the DDM Spec in ACCRDBRM we should generate and 
send CRRTKN if it was not sent to us.

crrtkn INSTANCE_OF CRRTKN - Correlation Token
1810 OPTIONAL
1811 DFTVAL â??â??
1812 NOTE Source server product-specific value is used.
1813 This parameter is returned if and only if the
1814 CRRTKN parameter is not received on
1815 ACCRDB.
