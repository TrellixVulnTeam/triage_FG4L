Reporting for Mamta Satoor.

If we use insert into desttable, select 
distinct from source, into a desttable which has autoincrement 
column in it, we might see gaps in the autoincrement column if 
there are duplicated rows in the source table. The reason for 
this is Derby projects values into destination table columns before 
building a distinct resultset from the source table. The piece 
of code doing this is in org.apache.derby.impl.sql.execute.ProjectRestrictResultSet class's getNextRowCore() method where it calls doProjection.
