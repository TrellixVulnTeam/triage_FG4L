I went through all the steps in BUILDING.txt (including downloading all of the jars except osgi.jar) and have tried to build using both the default compiler and jikes.  I've included both outputs in this message.

My ant.properties file:

j14lib=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home/lib
j13lib=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.3.1/Home/lib
build.compiler=jikes

Output when using Jikes (note:  I get tons of compile errors that all look like the one I've provided, all while compiling compile_iapi_jdbc_jdbc2):

     [echo]   Sane = true
     [echo]   Proceed = no
