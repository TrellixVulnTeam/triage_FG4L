Reporting for Mike Matrigali.

If upon reboot of the system a prepared but uncommitted 
transaction contains a drop of the conglomerate in the system 
with the highest Id in the system, and if a create conglomerate is then executed it will reused the conglomerate id of the dropped conglomerate. The system will work correctly once the outstanding prepared xact is committed or aborted.

Note:
It seems unlikely for users to in general include ddl in XA 
transactions, 
and even more rare for it to be the last conglomerate created, 
and even
more rare for the offending transaction to be left in prepared 
state across
a system shutdown.
