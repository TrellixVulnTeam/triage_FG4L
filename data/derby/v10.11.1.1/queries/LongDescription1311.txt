With derby jars at  10.1.2.4 - (400222) , 05/05 regression test run of derbyall on 10.1 codeline shows failure with wisconsin test with wctme5.7.   Deepa pointed out in DERBY-937 that wisconsin test has been enabled to run with j2me/foundation only in the trunk. It was not enabled in 10.1 branch. The exclude lines got removed from wisconsin_app.properties as part of port for DERBY-616 and hence we are seeing the failure. 

The issue "ERROR 40XT0: An internal error was identified by RawStore module" is actually caused by another exception which can be seen earlier in the diff file: "ERROR XJ001: Java exception: java.math.BigDecimal: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError'." This exception is expected as BigDecimal class is not available in this environment.
> ERROR 40XT0: An internal error was identified by RawStore module.

Resolution is to disable this test in  10.1
