There are currently two identical interfaces called EngineBlob and EngineClob.
Merging these into a single interface would simplify some of the code handling Blob and Clob in the network server, and it also allows a leaner implementation of a stored procedure freeing LOB locators without knowing if the locator represents a Blob or a Clob.
