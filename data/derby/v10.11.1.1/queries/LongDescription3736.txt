When a table level SELECT privilege is revoked, a dependent prepared statement is 
invalidated and can no longer be executed, but in the case of a column level privilege
SELECT privilege, the dependent prepared statement can still be executed.

This works as expected in 10.2, but does not work in all 10.3 and 10.4 releases.
