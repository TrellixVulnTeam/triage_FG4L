This is related to Cloudscape bug 4250.

Pass negative length as the stream length for various setXXXStream methods should throw an exception. But in Net Client mode, passing a negative value as stream length to PreparedStatement.setAsciiStream() doesn't throw an exception.

e.g. //from store/StreamingColumn
PreparedStatement ps = prepareStatement("insert into "
				+ "testLongVarCharInvalidStreamLength11 values(?, ?, ?)");
		ps.setInt(1, 100);
		try 
{
			println("===> testing using setAsciiStream with -2 as length");
			ps.setAsciiStream(2, fileIn, -2); // should throw exception here but doesn't.
                 }


This issue has been fixed for embedded mode, but not for client mode.
