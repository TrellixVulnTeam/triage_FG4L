Code inspection of the NetConnectionReply class reveals that the following methods are not used at all.


	verifyConnectReply(int codept)
	readDummyExchangeServerAttributes(Connection connection)
	checkRequiredObjects(boolean receivedFlag, boolean receivedFlag2, boolean receivedFlag3, boolean receivedFlag4, boolean receivedFlag5, boolean receivedFlag6)
	checkRequiredObjects(boolean receivedFlag, boolean receivedFlag2, boolean receivedFlag3, boolean receivedFlag4, boolean receivedFlag5, boolean receivedFlag6, boolean receivedFlag7)



It may be possible to just remove these methods if they are not required.
