I posted the following mail to derby-dev, see full thread here: http://www.nabble.com/Changes-to-the-STATUS-file-td17617479.html

Hello,



I was looking at the STATUS file we have in the SVN repository, and I
would like to suggest the following changes:

 1) Add the 10.3.3.0 release to the release list.

 2) Mismatch between release date for 10.4.1.3.
    The STATUS file says it was release on the 26th of April, whereas
    the download page says the 24th of April.
    BTW: Was there ever an [ANNOUNCE] mail for this release?

 3) Specify the dates in the release list using the international
    standard date notation (YYYY-MM-DD). See:
      http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html
      http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/iso-date
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601

 4) Indent the list of committers in a consistent way.

 5) Clarify what the sentence below means, and possibly remove it.
    "The Derby sub-project's modules will be available as distinct and
    discrete downloads".

 6) Remove extra dot character.
    "full-fledged Apache DB project.."


If the feedback for these changes are positive, I can create a Jira and
attach some patches for review. I guess change 1 has to go in anyway.

It is not entirely clear to my how often the STATUS file should be
updated, or if there is anyone who is more responsible than the
community in general to do it.


thanks,
â€“ 
Kristian
