When running a complex query on this table:

[code]
Create table DEMO.TEST (
    CHR                            CHARACTER(26)                   ,
    VCHR                           VARCHAR(25)                     )
[code]

then I get this exception:

AssertFailure: ASSERT FAILED col1.getClass() (class ...SQLChar) expected to be the same as col2.getClass() (class ....SQLVarchar)' was thrown while evaluating an expression.
