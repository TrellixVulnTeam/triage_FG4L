I discovered this problem while trying to get suites.All to run on the phoneME advanced platform, but it is easy to reproduce also with Java SE. 

The problem is that importing a table fails if there exists a table with the same name in a different schema. The error is:

ERROR 42X04: Column 'COLUMN2' is either not in any table in the FROM list or appears within a join specification and is outside the scope of the join specification or appears in a HAVING clause and is not in the GROUP BY list. If this is a CREATE or ALTER TABLE  statement then 'COLUMN2' is not a column in the target table.

If the table in the other schema is removed, the import command succeeds. If the import command is executed with an explicit schema name, instead of relying on "null" to give the default schema, the command also succeeds.

I believe this is a bug.

The following sequence of commands reproduces the problem:

ij version 10.4
ij> connect 'jdbc:derby:MyDbTest;create=true';
ij> create table t1 (a int);
0 rows inserted/updated/deleted
ij> insert into t1 values 1,2,3;
3 rows inserted/updated/deleted
ij> call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_TABLE(null, 'T1', 't1.txt', null, null, null);
0 rows inserted/updated/deleted
ij>  create schema iep;
0 rows inserted/updated/deleted
ij> create table iep.t1 (b int);
0 rows inserted/updated/deleted
ij> call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_IMPORT_TABLE(null, 'T1', 't1.txt', null, null, null, 0);
