RawTransaction implements

public void checkLogicalOperationOk() throws StandardException {
}

which is attempted to be overridden in derived class InternalXact, but is not done so because of a case problem in InternalXact
 public void checkLogicalOperationOK() 
throws StandardException 
{
    throw StandardException.newException(
    SQLState.XACT_NOT_SUPPORTED_IN_INTERNAL_XACT);
}

Code that calls this method thru the parent will not get the overridden method called.
