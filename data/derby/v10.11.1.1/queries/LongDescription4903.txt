The plan exporter tool fails to produce well-formed output for the following query:

ij> select * from sysibm.sysdummy1 where ibmreqd < 'Z';

The generation of XML doesn't fail, but when I open the file in Firefox, I see this message:

XML Parsing Error: not well-formed
Location: file:///tmp/plan.xml
Line Number 9, Column 11:

Operator: <
----------^

HTML generation prints the following error, and produces an empty file:

ERROR:  'The value of attribute "scan_qualifiers" associated with an element type "null" must not contain the '<' character.'
