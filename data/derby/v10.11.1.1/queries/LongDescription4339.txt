Not all sort avoidance paths are recognized by the optimizer.  Here is an example of the class targeted by this issue, from 
the wisc tests :

select * from --DERBY-PROPERTIES joinOrder=FIXED
TENKTUP2, TENKTUP1
where TENKTUP1.unique1 = TENKTUP2.unique1
and TENKTUP2.unique1 < 2500
order by TENKTUP1.unique1';

There is a unique index on TENKTUP1.unique1 and TENKTUP2.unique1.  To exercise the path, the plan
forces  TENKTUP2 as outermost join, knows that query result is sorted on TENKTUP2.unique1, but does not
recognize that because "TENKTUP1.unique1 = TENKTUP2.unique1" that query is also sorted on TENKTUP1.unique1 and could avoid a sort.

Note without the fixed join order a sort avoidance plan is picked by choosing the plan where TENKTUP1.unique1 is the
outermost node.
