The team which is localizing the 10.9 messages would like to audit our existing messages to ensure that they are easy to translate. A quick glance at their audit results shows many issues in the following categories:

1) Multi-line messages whose formatting confuses the translators. Translators tend to be language experts and not experts in the arcana of how Java properties files are formatted. I am hoping that these issues can be addressed by simply prefixing the multi-line messages with comments, explaining the arcane formatting.

2) Grammar, punctuation, and capitalization problems. I think we should just clean these up.

I am filing this issue as a place to hold patches which address issues raised by the localization audit.
