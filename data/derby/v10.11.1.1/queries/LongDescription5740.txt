The following code is executed, but the results are not used:
			CollectNodesVisitor visitor = new CollectNodesVisitor(ColumnReference.class);
			stmtnode.accept(visitor);
			Vector refs = visitor.getList();  <--- never used

I plan to remove the code, but just want to record it here in case there are side-effects by using the visitor.
