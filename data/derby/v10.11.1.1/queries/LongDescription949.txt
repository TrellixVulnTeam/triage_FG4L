Currently some tests have code to check the environment and get connection using DriverManager/DataSource. This logic has been moved to TestUtil.getConnection method. Cleanup tests to use this method. List of tests:

store/TestDurabilityProperty.java
store/backupRestore1.java
store/OnlineBackup tests
lang/logStream.java
lang/closed.java

Also, add comment to ij.startJBMS method mentioning TestUtil.getConnection method. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-907#action_12365954
