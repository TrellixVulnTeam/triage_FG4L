When giving null as table name to getBestRowIdentifier, getColumnPrivileges, getIndexInfo, getVersionColumns or getPrimaryKeys, the client driver fails with "SQLException: Table name can not be null". Embedded uses null as a wildcard and does not fail. Embedded and client should have the same behaviour.
