The derby_tests.policy file uses references to csinfo and db2j.
These are left-overs from pre-contribution and rename to apache and should get cleaned up.

I suspect that the db2j references can simply be taken out, but that should get double-checked.

The csinfo references are used in jvm.java. There referenced in the testing/README.htm.

I propose to change the name of these properties as follows:
csinfo.codejar - URL to the jar files when they are in the classpath 
     change to derby.codejar
csinfo.codeclasses - URL to the classes directory when it is in the classpath
     change to derby.codeclasses
csinfo.codedir - File location of either csinfo.codejar or csinfo.codejar.
     the comment said : // Only required due to a BUG.
     Need to figure out which 'BUG' that is and document better
     change to derby.codedir
csinfo.trustedhost
     change to derby.clienthost
     document: - specifies the clients ip address/hostName. 
csinfo.serverhost 
     change to derby.serverhost
     document: -Host name or ip where network server is started.
