Some of the error messages for database decryption (DERBY-5792) are not fully internationalized, as they take a hard-coded English message as an argument. We should make the messages come from messages.xml so that they can be localized.

As discussed in DERBY-5792, we may also want to merge the messages for encryption, re-encryption and decryption to reduce the total number of messages.
