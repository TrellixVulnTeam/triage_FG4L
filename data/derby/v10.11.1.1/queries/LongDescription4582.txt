This issue only appears to happen in Network Server/Client mode.  Embedded mode does not have the issue.

My timezone is American/Chicago.  Saving timestamps with values for the 6 hours prior to DST start are being read back in as values 1 hour later than written.  (I believe the issue happens on the write because values written in Network Server/Client mode and read in Embedded mode are incorrect, while values written and read in Embedded mode are corect.)

Values between 3/13/2010 - 20:00 CST and 3/14/2010 - 02:00 CST will return timstamps 1 hour off.  The "setTimestamp" method is being passed a GMT calendar with the timestamp:

I have a complete test class I can attach, but here is a summary:

private final TimeZone gmtTZ = TimeZone.getTimeZone("GMT");
private final Calendar gmtCal = Calendar.getInstance(gmtTZ);
...
String sql = "INSERT INTO app.dst_test (id, gmt_timestamp, milli_time) VALUES(?,?,?)";
String sql2 = "SELECT * from app.dst_test where id=?";
...
ps.setTimestamp(2, ts, gmtCal);
...
Timestamp tsRead = rs.getTimestamp("gmt_timestamp", gmtCal);
...
