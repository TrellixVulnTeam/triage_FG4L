To make it easier to write new in-memory back end tests, a class with a few convenience methods would be helpful.
I will add such a class, rewrite existing tests to use it (where appropriate) and finally add some new tests for dropping in-memory databases.

The tests will be disabled until the drop mechanism is implemented.
