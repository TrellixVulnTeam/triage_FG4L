The process of producing Maven 2 artifacts for Derby should be documented.
Good and clear documentation is important for the following reasons:

	The process is only carried out each time a Derby release is produced.
	A part of our users are using Maven in their projects, and they depend on the Maven 2 artifacts to upgrade Derby.
	It is likely that it isn't the same person carrying out the process from release to release.



As a rough starting point, some points to cover:

	Prerequisites, installation and environment setup.
	The artifact build process.
	Testing the artifacts.
	Deploying the artifacts.
	Verifying the deployment (with the central repository).
