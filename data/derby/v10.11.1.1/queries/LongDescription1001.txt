This test has failed on Solaris10 for a long time, due to issues with the default security provider on this OS. See DERBY-788 for details.

I consider rewriting this test as interresting because it allows us to see how things can be done in "the JUnit way". 

1) Run test with multiple encryption algorithms with minimal test code duplication.
2) Special handling of exceptions for specific providers (PCKS11-Solaris).

The rewritten test might cause some discussion on how we want to handle the issues mentioned above.
