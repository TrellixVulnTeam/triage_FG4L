The sequence of statements below give a NullPointerException. The statements are very similar to the ones in DERBY-4419, but this is a separate bug since the stack traces are different, and this bug can be seen all the way back to 10.1.1.0, whereas DERBY-4419 was a regression in 10.3. (On 10.0.2.1, a syntax error is raised instead of the NPE.)

ERROR XJ001: Java exception: ': java.lang.NullPointerException'.

Same error if INTERSECT is used instead of EXCEPT.
