I was describing everything here and when trying to submit - everything was lost, because the session ended and there was no way of going back, so I will just point to derby-user mailing list, everything is there, just follow the thread:
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/db-derby-user/201003.mbox/%3Ce0a08d801003190619l3d3181pa55ca79145b7810d@mail.gmail.com%3E
or there:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.db.derby.user/12394

The bottom line is - I had to change application to avoid the query, it is so slow (around one hour on production) and there is no workaround.
