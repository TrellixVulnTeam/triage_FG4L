When getBlob/getClob is called on the ResultSet, the current row is
locked if the JDBC driver does not cache the entire LOB value in
memory.  This is done to prevent the Blob/Clob object from being
changed.  Until now, this lock has been held to the end of the
transaction.

JDBC4 introduced free() methods for the Blob/Clob class.  The locking
should be changed so that the locks is releases when the Blob/Clob
object is freed.
