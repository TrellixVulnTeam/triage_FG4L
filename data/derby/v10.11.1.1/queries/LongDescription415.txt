If you run
  java org.apache.derby.tools.sysinfo -cp client SimpleApp.class

you get

FOUND IN CLASS PATH:

    Derby Client libraries (derbyclient.jar)


    user-specified class (SimpleApp)


NOT FOUND IN CLASS PATH:

    Derby Client libraries (db2jcc.jar)
    (com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver not found.)

The "NOT FOUND IN CLASSPATH" output is confusing and invalid because we're testing the network client, not the DB2 JCC client.
