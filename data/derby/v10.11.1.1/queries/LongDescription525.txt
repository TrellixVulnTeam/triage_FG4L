When calling Clob.getAsciiStream or ResultSet.getAsciiStream if 
the column type is a character type or a CLOB, then any out of 
range character (to the ASCII set) needs to be replaced by 0x3f 
('?', question mark). ASCII is defined as 8 bit characters, 
thus Unicode Characters in the range 0x0000 to 0x00ff are 
mapped to ASCII characters 0x00 to 0xff, and Unicode characters 
in the range 0x0100 to 0xffff are mapped to 0x3f
