PropertyUtil should use Properties.stringPropertyNames() (new method in Java 6) instead of Properties.propertyNames() since a Set<String> view of the property names is easier to work with than an Enumeration<?>. The Set<String> view can be used with for-each loops and many of the helper methods in the standard library.
