I like the idea of using the NetServlet with the derby.war file inside of tomcat to allow Tomcat to start and stop my derby database.  This makes it quite easy for some of our less than technical users.   However, the NetServlet.java file appears to have "localhost" hard coded as the startup host.  This forced Derby to start listening ONLY on 127.0.0.1.  I tried passing the -Dderby.drda.host parameter through the java startup of Tomcat, but it doesn't appear to have any affect.  Ideally, the NetServlet.java class should allow for a "host" parameter to be passed in via the web.xml file.  That way we can easily control the listening interface.
