1) Problem unzipping derby_doc_plugin_1.1.0.zip and derby_ui_plugin_1.1.0.zip:

rick doc-plugin (1.4) > unzip derby_doc_plugin_1.1.0.zip
Archive:  derby_doc_plugin_1.1.0.zip
  End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not
  a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the
  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on
  the last disk(s) of this archive.
unzip:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of derby_doc_plugin_1.1.0.zip or
        derby_doc_plugin_1.1.0.zip.zip, and cannot find derby_doc_plugin_1.1.0.zip.ZIP, period.


2) Old problem: Filenames in the src-tar distribution are truncated. What
is the use of this distribution?


3) Broken links in index.html:


	Could not find link to pdf for Getting Started. The file is called
    getstartderby.pdf but the link references getstart.pdf




	Could not find link to either of the html files for Working with Derby. The actual directory
    is workingwithderbytemp but should be workingwithderby




	Could not find the pdf for Working with Derby either. The
    workingwithderby subdirectory doesn't exist under the pdf branch.




	Could not find pdf for Admin Guide. The file is called
    derbyadmin.pdf but the link specifies adminguide.pdf
