Currently a CreateTableConstantAction sets a state in the activation indicating the activation is being used for a create table. This state is then subsequently used by CreateConstraintConstantaction and CreateIndexConstantAction. This state can be known at compile time and is much cleaner  (self-contained) if it is kept as an attribute of the constant action nodes, rather than forcing every Activation to have such a field.
