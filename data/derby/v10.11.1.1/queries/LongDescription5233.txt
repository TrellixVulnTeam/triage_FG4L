Cf the enclosed repro. It would be good to make Derby ignore the interrupt here. Cf DERBY-4741. Note that this is less serious than in the cases referred to in DERBY-4741: here the database does not get shut down, even the connection survives, cf the repro. So, this can be considered a follow-up to DERBY-4741 to further improve Derby's robustness under interrupts.
