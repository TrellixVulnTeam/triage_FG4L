Datetime datatypes in Derby are date, time and timestamp. Currently Derby doesn't allow any arithmetic operations on them, limiting their use. Enable datetime arithmetic in a standard way.

This feature has already been implemented in 10.1 and is documented in Derby 10.1 manuals. Refer to functionality there.
