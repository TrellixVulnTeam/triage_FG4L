When I did some profiling of Derby running with the test client in DERBY-1961, the profiling tool (Sun Studio's collect and analyzer) reported that BasePage.getPageId() used much CPU (although the method does almost nothing). Adding the 'final' keyword to the method definition seems to reduce the CPU usage and increase the throughput.
