DERBY-827 (correctly) changed the lifetime of the language ResultSet tree to be the lifetime of the activation, but did not fix up the correct calls to ResultSet.close() and ResultSet.finish().

A language ResultSet's lifetime should be driven by the activation, so activation.close() should call finish() on its ResultSet.

EmbedResultSet should call close on its language ResultSet (theResults field) when the JDBC ResultSet is closed, it should not be calling finish() on its ResultSet.

See comments in DERBY-827 for some more details and issues.
