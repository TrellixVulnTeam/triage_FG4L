The JDBC 4.0 Connection classes implement getTypeMap() by calling super.getTypeMap() and copying the resulting map. This is done to prevent an unchecked compiler warning that we would see if we simply returned super.getTypeMap() in this method. It would be cheaper and simpler to return super.getTypeMap() and ignore the warning.
