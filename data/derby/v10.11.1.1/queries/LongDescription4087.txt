Currently, the printing is often inconsistent:


	some subtrees not printed
	wrong indentation due to missing newlines, or lacking level increments
	redundant printing of subtrees (AST is really a DAG, would be nice to print only once and then refer back to show aliasing)
	some items printed twice due to inconsistent usage of pattern
