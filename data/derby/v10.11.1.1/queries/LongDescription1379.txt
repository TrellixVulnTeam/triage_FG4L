When running derbyall on jdk16 the Nist tests fails with the following exception:

  java.security.AccessControlException: access denied
  (java.util.PropertyPermission user.dir read)

The tests started to fail after autoloading of JDBC drivers was added to the embedded driver (see DERBY-930). 

To reproduce the problem you need (a) to run from jar files (not class files) and (b) have the DB2 driver in the class path.
