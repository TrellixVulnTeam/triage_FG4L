The security mechanism strong password substitution (securityMechanism=8) uses code that relies on entropy, which seems to be in short supply on some ARM systems. This includes the ARM server farm available in the ASF build/test farm.

I will disable tests using strong password substitution in NSSecurityMechanismTest on ARM platforms to be able to run the test to completion within a reasonable time.
DERBY-3106 and DERBY-5651 are relevant.
