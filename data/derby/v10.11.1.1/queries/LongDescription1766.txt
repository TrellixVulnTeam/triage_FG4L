The test jdbcapi/batchUpdate.java is disabled in the DerbyNetClient
framework.  The reason seems to be that you get a general exception,
BatchUpdateException, instead of the specific exceptions you get in
the embedded framework.  The fix for this is probably to unwrap the
BatchUpdateException to get to the more specific exception.

Since batchUpdate.java does not run in client/server, DERBY-1292 has
added a test to derbynet/prepStmt.java that really belongs in
batchUpdate.  As part of fixing this JIRA, that test, and other
similar tests in prepStmt, should be moved to batchUpdate.

It also seems like parameterMapping.java had similar problems
which was changed by changing the canon to expect
BatchUpdateExceptions.  In my opinion, one should also unwrap the
BatchUpdateExceptions in that test.
