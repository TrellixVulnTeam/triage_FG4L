jdbcaip.DataSourceReferenceTest tests the JavaBean properties of the various data sources Derby has, and also recreation using Reference(able) and serialization/deserialization.
As part of implementing JDBC statement pooling (see DERBY-3313), a new property must be introduced in some of the data source classes.
The test must be extended to handle data sources with differing property sets.

There are a few comments regarding this in DERBY-3325.
