May also be the case for connections obtained from EmbeddedConnectionPoolDataSource.

ResultSet.getStatement() is returning the undetlying "physical" java.sql.Statement object, not the brokered object.

Bug as applications can then get at the underlying "physical" connection and thus continue to
 use a connection that may have been assigned to someone else. Causes FAIL messages in the
new jdbcapi/XATest, real checks should be added in checkDataSource to ensure all the possible
connection objects are checked.
