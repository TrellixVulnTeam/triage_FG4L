The javadoc for NetworkServer control says:


tracedirectory <tracedirectory> [-h <host>] [-p <portnumber>]: This changes where new trace files will be placed. For sessions with tracing already turned on, trace files remain in the previous location. Default is clousdcape.system.home
------

Apart from the problem of cloudscape.system.home instead of derby.system.home, when I turn tracing on the trace files are created in the current directory (user.dir) and not derby.system.home. Also if the documentation is correct, then the location when derby.system.home is not set should be specified.

java -Dderby.system.home=$PWD/dsh  org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl  start

Then turn tracing on with

java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl  trace on

and connect.
