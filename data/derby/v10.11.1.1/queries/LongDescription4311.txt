BaseJDBCTestCase.assertErrorCode() doesn't throw an exception if the error code does not match the expected code.

    public static void assertErrorCode(String message, int expected, SQLException exception) {
       while (exception != null)
       {
           try 
{
               assertEquals(message, expected,exception.getErrorCode());
           }
 catch (AssertionFailedError e) 
{
               // check and see if our error code is in a chained exception
               exception = exception.getNextException();               
           }
       }
    }

If the error code doesn't match, assertEquals() will raise an error, but the exception is caught and silently ignored.

Since none of the tests uses assertErrorCode() I suggest we remove it. We can re-implement one that works later if the need arises.
