I start the server using an ipv4 address

java derbyrun.jar server start -h x.x.x.x

Then I connect from a remote client  and hit an AccessControlException

The ip in the exception is that of the client, not the server.

This setup works in 10.2.2.0.

Same problem if the hostname is in derby.properties

Problem can be worked around by using -noSecurityManager when starting the server
