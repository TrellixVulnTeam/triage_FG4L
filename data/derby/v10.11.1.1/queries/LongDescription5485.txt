The PropertySetter task sets up classpath variables so that the build can take advantage of JVM-specific class libraries. Using those libraries makes it possible for the compiler to flag code which is supposed to run on less capable platforms but which calls methods from later JVMs. This is a very tricky problem and we seem to have reached consensus that it requires too much effort to make PropertySetter run correctly in all of the build environments which Derby developers use. I will attach a proposal for how to simplify PropertySetter so that it requires less effort to maintain.
