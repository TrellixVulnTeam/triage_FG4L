JDBC 4.0 introduced the java.sql.RowId interface. Derby has implemented this interface both in the client driver and the embedded driver, but the methods only throw java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException, and an application has no way to get a RowId object. To reduce the footprint, these unused classes should be removed.
