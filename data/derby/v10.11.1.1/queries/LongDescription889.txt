On client getTimestamp on a TIME column will print date   1900-01-01 instead of the current date like the embedded driver.
To repro run the DERBY-877 repro without specifying a file.encoding

java TestEnc derbynetclient
[snip]
COLUMN 2:TM TIME
        getString:      16:27:35
        getTimeStamp:   1900-01-01 16:27:35.0
        getTime:        16:27:35
        getDate         Exception SQLSTATE:null  (EXPECTED)


With Embedded  it prints the current date for getTimestamp
java TestEnc  derby

COLUMN 2:TM TIME
        getString:      16:27:35
        getTimeStamp:   2006-01-28 16:27:35.0
        getTime:        16:27:35
        getDate         Exception SQLSTATE:22005  (EXPECTED)
