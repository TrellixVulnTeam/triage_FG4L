WorkHorseForCollatorDatatypes.java has a method getCollationElementsForString() which currently gets
called when processing like clauses in databases that have been created with territory based collation, this is
not an issue in pre-10.3 databases or post 10.3 default databases.
getCollationElementsForString gets the collation elements for the entire  value of the String held by
the datatype using the class.

If you take the case of pattern 'A%' and the value of datatype is 'BXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', 
then it would have been better to  better to get collation elements one character of the String value at a time
to avoid the  process of getting collation elements for the entire string when we don't really need it 
One could imagine this might have a huge performance impact on running like against a long clob where
the like pattern has leading fixed-length pattern to match.
