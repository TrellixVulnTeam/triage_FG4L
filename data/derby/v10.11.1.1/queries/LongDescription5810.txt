When running the compatibility test with EMMA instrumented jars, it fails because it starts sub-processes without putting emma.jar on their classpath. We should make it construct a working classpath for its sub-processes if it detects that it's running with instrumented jars.

This will be easier to fix once DERBY-5808 is checked in.
