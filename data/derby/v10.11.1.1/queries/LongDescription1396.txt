The class org.apache.derby.impl.drda.ReEncodedInputStream seems to have a bug...

In this class, there exists next code.

        int count;
	if(( count = reader.read(decodedBuffer_, 0, BUFFERED_CHAR_LEN )) < 1 )
{
	    return null;
	}

In this code, the condition of "<1" was intended to judge whether reader was read entirely.
However,spec of java api says that reader returns -1 if the end of the reader has been reached and not 0.
Then "<1" is not appropriate.

Current code judges 0 as the end of reader.
Then, if 0 was returned in the meaning that "No character was read now but may continue" as possible in java api, 
this code will not work correctly...
