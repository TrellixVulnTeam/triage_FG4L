Jorgen says-

I suggest that the replication step in which the master database is frozen is replaced by a new system procedure to solve index and import:

Old: SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_FREEZE_DATABASE()
New: SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_PREPARE_REPLICATION()

The new system procedure should:
1) Freeze the database
2) Check if there are any ongoing transactions with unlogged operations. If so - unfreeze and abort. Otherwise:
3) Enable logging of unlogged operations
