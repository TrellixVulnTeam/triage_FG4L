Separating a part of DERBY-514 into a sub-task. This sub-task is to combine the script 'runphases.ksh' and the java file 'phaseTester.java' into a single java test. This will help to later add the upgrade tests into the regression suite. Also, this sub-task can be done independent of DERBY-1049 which is blocking DERBY-514.
