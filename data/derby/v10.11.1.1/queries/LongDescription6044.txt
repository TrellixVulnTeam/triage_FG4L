On the Derby release download page(s) there is a table containing JIRA issue ids and descriptions. Because some of the descriptions are very long, mostly because they contain long test names with no natural point for a break, some browsers break up "DERBY-XXXX" at the hyphen. This makes the page much harder to read, and should be addressed.
