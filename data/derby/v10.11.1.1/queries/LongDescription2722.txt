As per the wiki page http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/BuiltInLanguageBasedOrderingDERBY-1478, assign correct collation type for results of CHAR, VARCHAR and XMLSERIALIZE functions. The rule as copied from the wiki page is as follows
6)CHAR, VARCHAR and XMLSERIALIZE functions do not look like they are defined in the SQL spec. Their behavior can be defined as similar to CAST ie, the result character string of CHAR/VARCHAR/XMLSERIALIZE will have the same collation as current schema's character set. The collation derivation will be implicit.
