On the nightly run for 4/27 - 10.5.1.2 - (769232), I saw client jdbcapi/derbystress.java  run out of heap space.   The test has not failed like this before on the same machine with the same JVM, and the one checkin on that day DERBY-3991 could not account for this failure.

I will attach the javacore and heapdump.  Taking a quick look at the heap dump, it seems to have a lot of client side Statement objects, which seems to be just the leak the test is checking for.  Note: the test runs with 64MB heap.  It would be interesting to run with other jvms and force a gc() and a heap dump at this point in the test and see if we still have a lot of Statement objects or if this is a specific platform/JVM issue.

The trace at the time of failure was :
