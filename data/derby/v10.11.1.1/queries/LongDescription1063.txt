Support execution of the tools with java-jar using the manifest Class-Path attribute. Originally added as part of DERBY-1019, this seeks to reinstate thee functonality that was removed as a result of DERBY-1045. Create a new jar file to execute the tools, along with an improvement to sysinfo to report the location of the jars from which the info properties files are loaded. Note that this does not attempt to mitigate the current problems running sysinfo under a security manager, but to improve the reporting of the locations of the loaded files if they are not loaded from the classpath.
