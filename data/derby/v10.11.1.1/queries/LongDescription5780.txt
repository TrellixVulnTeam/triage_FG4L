Mamta has run some performance tests on windows, with (Enable write caching on the device AND Turn off Windows write-cache buffer flushing on the device) that shows 
performance degredation of identity columns.  See results posted in DERBY-5471, copied here:
Rick, first of all, I want to apologize for not responding to this jira sooner. I allowed other jiras to prioritize over this but I finally got around to running a long set of tests and here are the results of them. I have truned off debugging prints in these test runs.

I ran lots of test as explained below on released 10.8.2.2 jars and top of the trunk(revision 1341151) insane jars with write caching off and the test results between the 2 set of jars do vary. I have Windows7 service pack1 laptop(Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2720QM CPU @2.20GHz, 8GB RAM) with IBM jdk 1.6

I chose to run with preallocation sizes of 5 and 20 because I think the default preallocation for 10.8 is 5 and for trunk is 20.

Variations of test(with 3 test runs of each on 10.8 and trunk jars)

> I have been trying to run org.apache.derbyTesting.perf.clients.Runner (which provides ways to stress test sequence generator and identity columns) on trunk and 10.8.2.2 RC3 to compare the performance and I find that it takes almost double the time for the tests to finish on trunk. Additionally, the identity column test consistently ran into lock timeouts on trunk. I am running with insane jars on trunk and 10.8.2.2 RC3. The test in question is not in official jars for the release candidate so I manually copied them to 10.8.2.2 RC3 environment during my test(basically copied the entire org.apache.derbyTesting.perf.clients.Runner directory from trunk to 10.8.2.2 RC3 environment).
> Command to do sequence stress testing is as follows
> java org.apache.derbyTesting.perf.clients.Runner -driver org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver -init -load seq_gen -load_opts debugging=1,numberOfGenerators=5,tablesPerGenerator=10,insertsPerTransaction=100,identityTest=0 -gen b2b -threads 10
> Command to do identity column stress testing is as follows
> time java org.apache.derbyTesting.perf.clients.Runner -driver org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver -init -load seq_gen -load_opts debugging=1,numberOfGenerators=5,tablesPerGenerator=10,insertsPerTransaction=100,identityTest=1 -gen b2b -threads 10
> An average run on 10.8.2.2 RC3 for sequence stress test is about a minute and 46 secs. On trunk, on an average it takes 2 and half minutes
> An average run on 10.8.2.2 RC3 for identity stress test is about a minute and 50 secs. On trunk, on an average it takes 3minsutes and 30 secs. Also, on trunk, this test runs into lock timeouts.
> I was wondering if this is the right behavior. The performance should be better in trunk because of pre-allocation of range for sequences and identity columns(which defaults to 20) but unless I have missed something in my tests, the results don't show the performance improvement.
