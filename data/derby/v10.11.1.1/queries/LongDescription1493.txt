The embedded driver throws Util.notImplemented() when PreparedStatement.setNull(int, int, String) is called. The javadoc says that "[if] the parameter does not have a user-defined or REF type, the given typeName is ignored." The client driver correctly ignores typeName and forwards the call to setNull(int, int). Embedded should be changed to match the client.
