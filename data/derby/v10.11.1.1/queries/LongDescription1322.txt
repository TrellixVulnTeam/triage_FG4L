Please see the enclosed repro program.

When attempting the deleteRow, it will fail with SQL state 24000 "no
current row", since the first() call doesn't properly reset the
IsOnInsertRow_ state. By inspection of ../am/ResultSet.java I found
the other positioning calls beside next and moveToCurrentRow to suffer
the same problem.
