A set of state information is required about byte streams representing characters to be able to handle them properly.

The basic pieces of information are:

	is bufferable
	is position aware
	data offset
	current byte position
	current char position
	byte length
	char length



Additional info:

	encoding
	max allowed length
	bytes per char information



The information is chosen with UTF8Reader in mind, and the plan is to pass a CharacterStreamDescriptor instance to the constructor to allow the reader to configure itself appropriately. The information is expected to be valid only at a specific point in time, as some of it will change as soon as the reader starts working with the underlying stream.
