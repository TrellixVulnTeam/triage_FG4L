In addition to the JDBC 4.1 bits which were visible in the Java 7 javadoc, a couple other items appear in the JDBC 4.1 Maintenance Review spec. This spec has been published on the JCP website at http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/jdbc-4_1-mrel-eval-spec/index.html. I will attach a functional spec for the remaining bits.
