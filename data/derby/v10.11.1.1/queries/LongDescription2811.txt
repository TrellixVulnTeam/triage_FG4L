The default policy file installed has this stanza:
  :
  permission java.net.SocketPermission "$
{derby.drda.host}
:*", "accept"; 
  :

Normally, specifying -h 0.0.0.0 to NetworkServerControl lets clients connect
from any host, but with the default policy file installed
connecting fails even from localhost.

I think this is because SocketPermission only recognizes "*" as a catch-all.
