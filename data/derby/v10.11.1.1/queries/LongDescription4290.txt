Since 783408 2009-06-10 18:02:38 MEST suites.All hangs on phoneME/cvm.

The problem appears to be a hardcoded limitation in  phoneME/cvm: 'java.lang.InternalError: Number of class names exceeds vm limit.'
In addition the cvm vm just hangs instead of aborting, causing the test to hang.

Until this may be fixed in phoneME/cvm I suggest to create and run independent subsuites of suites.AllPackages when testing on phoneME/cvm.
