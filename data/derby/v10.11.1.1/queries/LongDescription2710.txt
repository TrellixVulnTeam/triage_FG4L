I think Code needs to be added to opensource/java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/LikeEscapeOperatorNode.java
to disable like optimization for databases with non-default collation.  There is left over code in this routine that says it disables it for national char by adding a cast to one of the two sides which I assume then stops some other code from considering the 
optimization.
