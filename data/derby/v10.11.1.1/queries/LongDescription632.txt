The test derbynet/dataSourcePermissions_net.java doesn't run with derbyclient, unless IBM's Universal Driver is in the classpath.

The test gets erroneously skipped with the following comment:
This test/suite is excluded from running with JCC versions at or before 1.1.

There's something wrong in the test harness' skipping mechanism that it decides this.
