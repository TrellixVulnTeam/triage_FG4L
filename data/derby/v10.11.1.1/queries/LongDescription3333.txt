SQL Standard (foundation) says:

Section 5.4 SR 20) No <authorization identifier> shall specify "PUBLIC".

This is a syntax rule which implies a 42xxx SQL state but I wonder if 'invalid authorization specification.' (28xxx) makes more sense?
Maybe it's 28xxx when used in a connection request and 42xxx in a SQL statement?

Needs to be disallowed on:
  JDBC connection requests
  GRANT statements, ie. using "PUBLIC" as a delimited identifier.

Existing application impact if the exists a user with an authorization identifier of PUBLIC in an existing system.
