Please see enclosed repro.

These detectability methods fail to check that they can be called in
some states. In the repro, calls are allowed while on insert row and
when after last row. These should both fail. Both clients have the
same problem. All three detectability methods have the same problem.
(repro only shows it for a subset of the cases).
