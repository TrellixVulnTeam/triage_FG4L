Network server re-uses DRDAStatement and DRDAResultSet objects when client sends a request with same section number. When re-using DRDAStatement, it's close() method is called which inturn calls close() method of DRDAResultSet. For re-use to work properly, we have to ensure the states of these objects are reset. This is not a bug but it is an area for possible improvements like:


	The reset of all states are not in the close() methods. The states get re-initialized at different places in the code. Fo example, in case of DRDAResultSet, they get initialized in some other DRDAStatement methods - like addResultSet, setRsDefaultOptions, setOPNQRYOptions, setQueryOptions etc. It will be good to have all resets in one method.
	The method name "close" is confusing since it is also called when objects get re-used. For clarity, it may be good to have a method named reset(). And then have the close method call reset.
