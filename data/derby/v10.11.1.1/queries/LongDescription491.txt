When Derby Network Server tries to return ~32K or greater data as part of the result set for a stored procedure, a protocol exception occurs and causes deallocation of the connection. Repro can be found in the "stored_proc_repro.java" file, which uses the stored procedure "BIG_COL" declared in "storedProcs.java". Both files are attached to this bug.
