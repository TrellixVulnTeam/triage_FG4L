DERBY-4565 added a concurrency test for sequence generators to test the possible race condition for allocating a new range of pre-allocated numbers for the sequence. I have been looking at enhancing that test to provide similar test for identity columns. I plan to add another command line parameter to the test which will run the concurrency test to stress identity column generator.
