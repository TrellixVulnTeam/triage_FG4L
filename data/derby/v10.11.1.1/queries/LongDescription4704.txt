With the following table definition and query

CREATE TABLE T (X VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO T VALUES 'true', 'false', 'unknown';
SELECT CAST(X AS BOOLEAN) FROM T;

the meta-data for the returned result will say that the column is not nullable, although it will contain a NULL value in the third row.
