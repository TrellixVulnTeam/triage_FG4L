Export should not overwrite existing files, but rather insist that the user remove them before writing to the file.  This will help prevent accidental or intentional corruption of the database with export.  This may introduce a compatibility issue with export but because export is usually an attended utility and not typically invoked as part of an application, I think the risk is worth the additional security this will provide.
