The Derby  JDBC client side statement cache should consult the value of the isPoolable hint before caching prepared statements.

This will give users the ability to avoid that short-lived prepared statements push out more frequently used prepared statements in the case of a full statement cache.
The API JavaDoc says that it is up to the cache whether the hint is used or not.
