Investigate how much resources Derby uses and in which parts of the
code they are used on an in-memory database. Find numbers for
different kinds of load: single-record update and select operations,
and join operations.

Example of resource usage that could be measured: CPU, wall-clock
time, system calls, context switches, monitor contention, object
allocations, garbage collection, I/O.
