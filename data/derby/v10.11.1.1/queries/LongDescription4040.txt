SQLChar.getLength() returns the wrong length of the data value in some cases.
For the bug to be triggered, the value must contain characters that are represented by two or three bytes, and Derby must store the value as a stream.

In my ad-hoc testing, I found that a value of length 10886 with CJK characters doesn't trigger the bug, but 10887 does trigger the bug. Further, for a range of lengths the bug can also been observed for CLOB columns (when doing 'select length(clobcolumn)').
