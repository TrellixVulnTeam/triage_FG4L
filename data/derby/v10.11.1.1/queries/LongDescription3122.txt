org.apache.derby.client.am.Clob has a private field named internalLengthStmt_. It is initialized to null, and it is never set to any other value. It is referred to in the code, but then it is only checked whether it is non-null, in which case its closeX() method is called. I think the field and all the code that uses it can be removed.
