The message XSDFI reads in English:
"Error encountered while trying to write data to disk during database
recovery.  Check that the database disk is not full. If it is then
delete unnecessary files, and retry connecting to the database.  It is
also possible that the file system is read only, or the disk has
failed, or some other problem with the media.  System encountered
error while process page 
{0}."

It seems the end of the last sentence is a little uncomfortable.
Should that be 'while processing page {0}
'?

Thx,
