The ij tool gives the following help output:

Usage: java org.apache.derby.tools.ij [-p propertyfile] [-ca connectionAttributePropertyFile] [inputfile]

The -ca connectionAttributePropertyFile option is no longer needed and is deprecated, so it is not documented in the Tools Guide. The option should also be removed from the usage statement.
