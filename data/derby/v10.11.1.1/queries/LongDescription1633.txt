Database can be assumed to be same as in Derby - 1205 Jira issue

SELECT PORT1.PORT_ID FROM T_RES_PORT PORT1, T_VIEW_ENTITY2PORT ENTITY2PORT WHERE ENTITY2PORT.PORT_ID = PORT1.PORT_ID

This works fine in 10.1.2.1 but fails thereafter complaining that Comparison between INTEGER and CHAR is not supported

for some reason, it thinks one of the PORT_ID columns is a character, when in reality both are integers.

		SELECT DISTINCT 
		    ZONE.ZONE_ID ZONE_ID, 
			 PORT2ZONE.ZONE_MEMBER_ID  
		FROM  
			 T_RES_ZONE ZONE left outer join T_VIEW_PORT2ZONE PORT2ZONE on  
			 ZONE.ZONE_ID = PORT2ZONE.ZONE_ID   ,  T_RES_FABRIC FABRIC 

In this query, it is complaining that one of the columns is a VARCHAR and cannot be compared to INTEGER, when clearly this is not the case...

Same issue
