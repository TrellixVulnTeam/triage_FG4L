I am intermittently receiving Distributed Protocol Error exceptions in my client code. Simultaneously,
my derby.log is recording Distributed Protocol Error exceptions on the server side.

I cannot reliably reproduce this problem. 

However, the problem always occurs in the same section of my application, so I can at least
describe that section of my application. (I'll do so in an attachment).

Here is the error I receive on the server side. Sometimes, the CODPNT is 2116 and the
Error Code Value is 1d, rather than 2114 and e.
