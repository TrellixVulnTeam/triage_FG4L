The SELECT query in HeapScan is initialized like this:

        select = openDefaultConnection().prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM "+tableName);

The test cases commit the transaction like this:

        getConnection().commit();

openDefaultConnection() opens and returns a new connection to the default database, whereas getConnection() returns a cached default connection, so the two connections are not the same, and the transaction that's being committed is not the executing transaction.
