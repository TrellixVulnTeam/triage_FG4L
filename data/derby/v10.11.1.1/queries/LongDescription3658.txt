Reported by Daniel Noll on derby-user: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.db.derby.user/9107

To reproduce:

  1. Create a database with Derby 10.2.2.0
  2. Create a table with a clob column and insert some data
  3. Access that database with client+server at version 10.4.1.3 and iterate through the rows in the table

You'll see an error message like this:

ERROR 42Y03: 'SYSIBM.CLOBRELEASELOCATOR' is not recognized as a function or procedure.
