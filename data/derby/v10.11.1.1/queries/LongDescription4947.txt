The method getDependents(Provider) in BasicDependencyManager isn't using proper synchronization in cases where a list has to be compiled by combining in-memory and on-disk dependencies. Returning a reference to the list obtained from the shared map is also a bug.
The test lang.XplainStatisticsTest.testSimpleQueryMultiWithInvalidation failed due to this issue (see [1]).
