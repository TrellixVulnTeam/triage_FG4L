During initial contribution some tests were created with references to ldap security mechanism.
However, because we don't have ourselves setup for a public ldap server, these tests have fallen by the wayside.
Specifically, there is still a secureUsers .out file in functionTests.master that uses some ldap references, and there's the -not running - jdbcapi.xaJNDI.java.

These should be turned into junit tests out of these that take properties for the ldapserver, port, and dnString.
If we ever get a Zone, with an ldap server, or somehow get access to another public ldap server, then we can modify the tests to have the correct references.
