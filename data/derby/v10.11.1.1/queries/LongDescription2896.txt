I tried adding DatabaseMetaDataTest.suite() to be run within CollationTest so that it would test DatabaseMetaData within a collated database.
I had to fix one item in JDBC.dropSchema() where a string constant was being compared to a system column while not in a system schema,
but with that fixed the next error hit was executing DatabaseMetaData.getTables().

I will add the code to collation test with the use of DatabaseMetaDataTest commented out with this bug number.
