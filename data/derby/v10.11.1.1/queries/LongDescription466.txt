The second query should return two rows but returns just one.

ij> select * from t1;
I          |V         
----------------------
1          |row 1     
2          |row 2     

2 rows selected
ij> select * from t1, (select distinct 1 from t1) as sub(c);
I          |V         |C          
----------------------------------
1          |row 1     |1          

1 row selected

More specifically, this bug will show up when the sql layer does duplication elimination for distinct without a sorter (i.e. the underlying result set is already sorted). The result set will return correct data the first time, but after it is closed and re-opened it will not return any data rows.
