If there is a free DRDAConnThread when a client connects to the network server, the session is put into a queue from which one of the free DRDAConnThreads can pick it up. However, if another client connects after the session was put into the queue, but before the DRDAConnThread has picked it up, one might end up with more sessions in the queue than there are free threads. This can lead to hangs like the ones that we currently see in many of Ole's tests (for instance checkDataSource - http://www.multinet.no/~solberg/public/Apache/TinderBox_Derby/testlog/SunOS-5.10_i86pc-i386/440518-derbyall_diff.txt).
