testDefault fixture has been failing atleast since August 18th 2009 with following exception. I do not have access to test results fro 15th, 16th and 17th so not sure if the failure started earlier. It seemed to have run find on August 14th 2009.

This is happening both on trunk and 10.5 codelines. Not sure of other codelines. The failure appears on Windows but not on Linux. The jvms that definitely show the failures are ibm 15 and ibm16

Does anyone know of the cause of the failure?
