Sections 14.2.3 and [14.2.3] of JDBC 3.0 spec say

Column names supplied to getter [updater] methods are case insensitive. If a select list
contains the same column more than once, the first instance of the column will be
returned [updated].

Derby returns or updates the last column in the select list, not the first. With the attached Java class I see

PRE-UPDATE
1,100
POST-UPDATE
1,500
POST-UPDATE getXXX(name)
AB:500,ab500
