I am pasting here the communication from the mailinglist. I am having a blocking and large problem with it because I have to make a release that needs the specified SQL query.

Hi Tom - 

I see what you mean using the demo DB toursDB: 

ij> select * from airlines order by lower(airline_full); 
A&|AIRLINE_FULL            |BASIC_RATE            |DISTANCE_DISCOUNT

ij> select distinct * from airlines order by lower(airline_full); 
ERROR 4287A: The ORDER BY clause may not specify an expression, since 
the query specifies DISTINCT. 
ij> select distinct airline_full from airlines order by lower(airline_full); 
ERROR 4287A: The ORDER BY clause may not specify an expression, since

I didn't find a JIRA enhancement to remove this restriction.  I suggest 
you file an Enhancement request to remove the restriction reported by 
ERROR 4287A.
