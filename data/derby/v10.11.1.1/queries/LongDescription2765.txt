All the data types in Derby have a DTD associated with them. Starting Derby 10.3, DTDs for character string types will have collation type and derivation associated with them. The numbered list in Section Collation Determination on the wiki page http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/BuiltInLanguageBasedOrderingDERBY-1478 list rules for the collation setting. But just to be sure that we have not missed anything, we should go through the Derby code and look for character string DTD creation and see if the collation is set correctly.
