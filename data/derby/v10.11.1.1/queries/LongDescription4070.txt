If a connection attribute is badly formatted, for instance if the attribute name is specified without a corresponding value, the embedded and the client data sources throw different exceptions:
  o XJ212: Invalid attribute syntax: bad
  o XJ028: The URL 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/wombat;bad' is not properly formed.

Currently the only client data source affected is ClientDataSource, but the connection pool and XA data sources also have to deal with this issue when DERBY-4067 has been fixed.
