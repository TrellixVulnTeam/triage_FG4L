Add a framework for performance tests to be added in derby. 

Some goals are : 
– use Junit, thus will serve double duty as both functional tests as well as performance tests.
– builds upon the existing infrastructure available to run functional tests 

	for example, getting connections is handled in a single way allowing the performance tests to run with J2ME, DriverManager, DataSource, single leg of an XA transaction etc.
	
		be able to run using Junit directly.
		easy for developers to add these tests and run them.
