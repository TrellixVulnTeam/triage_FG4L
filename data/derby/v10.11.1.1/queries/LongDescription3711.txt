The store/aes.sql test can, because it's a master-based test, only test what's guaranteed available, i.e. only the encryptionKeyLength=128.
If it were a junit test, we could make it ignore the expected failures if the larger key sizes weren't supported, but test otherwise.

Having a junit test doesn't guarantee the test would get executed, of course, but at least the test would exist. 

Would it be useful/ok to have a message print to the console as a warning?
