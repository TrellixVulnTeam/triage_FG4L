The memory requirements for the upgrade tests seem to go up each time we add a new release. Lately, they've started failing on phoneME with the error message saying "Number of class names exceeds vm limit." It looks to me as if the problem is that we don't shut down the engine when we've finished testing a version, so we eventually end up with 19 different versions of the engine loaded in the same process. I think it would be good to shut down the old engines when we're done with them to free up resources.
