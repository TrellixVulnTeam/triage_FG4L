Stanislav Bryzgalov reported that the following script raises an NPE on the last query (a left join involving an aggregate). I have verified this in my environment:

drop table t1;
drop table t2;

– create two simple tables
CREATE TABLE T1( D1 DATE NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, N1 VARCHAR( 10 ) );
CREATE TABLE T2( D2 DATE NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, N2 VARCHAR( 10 ) );

– insert some data, two recs in T1 and one in T2
INSERT INTO T1 VALUES( DATE( '2008-10-01' ), 'something' ), ( DATE( '2008-10-02' ), 'something' );
INSERT INTO T2 VALUES( DATE( '2008-10-01' ), 'something' );

– this runs fine, gives one record '2008-10-02'
SELECT T1.D1
  FROM T1
  LEFT JOIN T2
  ON T1.D1 = T2.D2
  WHERE T2.D2 IS NULL;

– this runs fine too, gives one record '2008-10-02'  
SELECT MAX( T1.D1 ) as D
  FROM T1
  WHERE T1.D1 NOT IN ( SELECT T2.D2 FROM T2 );

– this one breaks!!!
– SQL State = XJ001 SQL Code = -1 SQL Message = DERBY SQL error: SQLCODE: -1, SQLSTATE: XJ001, SQLERRMC: java.lang.NullPointerException
SELECT MAX( T1.D1 ) AS D
  FROM T1
  LEFT JOIN T2
  ON T1.D1 = T2.D2
  WHERE T2.D2 IS NULL;
