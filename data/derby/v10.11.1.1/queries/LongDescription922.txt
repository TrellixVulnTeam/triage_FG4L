I think

     if (JVMInfo.JDK_ID >= JVMInfo.J2SE_14 )
     {
         sqle.initCause(getCause());
     }

 should have been

     if (JVMInfo.JDK_ID >= JVMInfo.J2SE_14 )
     {
         sqle.initCause(this);
     }

 It is the SqlException that is the cause of the SQLException. The
 cause of an SqlException is often null, and if we pass the null value
 to SQLException.initCause(), we lose all of the driver internal stack
 trace, and it makes debugging very difficult. All we get in the stack
 trace is SqlException.getSQLException(), the top-level JDBC method and
 the application stack.
