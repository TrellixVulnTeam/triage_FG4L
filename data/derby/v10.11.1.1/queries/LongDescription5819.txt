Sometimes it's useful to be able to attach to subprocesses of tests with a debugger.
Now that we have centralized subprocess creation in BaseTestCase#execJavaCmd it would be easy and useful to have subprocesses start, but wait for a debugger to attach to them, i.e. with these options on an Oracle VM:

-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=<port>,server=y,suspend=y
