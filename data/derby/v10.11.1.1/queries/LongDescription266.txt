SYMPTOM: The test "tools/dblook_test" will fail. The diff looks similar to this:


	
	
		
		
			Start: dblook_test jdk1.4.2_02 derbyall:derbytools 2005-05-06 22:37:37 ***
4861d4860
< java.io.FileNotFoundException: <filePath>
Test Failed.
			End:   dblook_test jdk1.4.2_02 derbyall:derbytools 2005-05-06 22:37:53 ***

ANALYSIS: The problem lies with the sed
functionality in the test harness, which delete certain lines before
comparing with the master file.

Sed.java in the harness removes lines containing derby/ in the path,
viz:

 	deleteLines.addElement("^.derby/.\\<.\\>\\(.).*$");	
 	deleteLines.addElement("^.derby/.\\(.).$");	

so if your tests are running in a directory containing this pattern, a
line too much is deleted from dblook_test.tmp, thereby giving a
comparison failure like you describe.

I don't know the reason for this deletion yet, so I can't say how to
fix it, but the work-around is obvious: Run test in a directory whose
name does not contain this pattern
