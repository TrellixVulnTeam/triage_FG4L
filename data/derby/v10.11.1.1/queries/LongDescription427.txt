While trying to connect in ij under XA environment, I get an error message which talks about looking into cloudscape.LOG rather than derby.log Here are the steps to reproduce
Just have derbytools.jar in the classpath and try to connect using ij as follows
java -Dij.exceptionTrace=true org.apache.derby.tools.ij
xa_datasource 'c:/dellater/db1drda';

The ij window throws following exception
IJ ERROR: org.apache.derby.impl.tools.ij.ijException: EmbeddedXADataSource not in classpath, please put derby.jar file in your classpath : EmbeddedXADataSource not in classpath, please put derby.jar file in your classpath (see cloudcape.LOG)

The error message should say (see derby.log) rather than (see cloudscape.LOG)
