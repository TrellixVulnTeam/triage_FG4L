The implementation of scrollable insensitive result sets
made some warning messages redundant. They should be removed.

For XJ125 we should consider removing "sensitive" from text since it is
not currently supported:

> XJ125.S=This method should only be called on ResultSet objects that
>         are scrollable (type TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE or
>         TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE). 

-> 

> XJ125.S=This method should only be called on ResultSet objects that
>         are scrollable (type TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE).
