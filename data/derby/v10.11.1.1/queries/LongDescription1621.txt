A trigger action statement, such as an INSERT statement is not recompiled when there is some DDL change on the underlying table, such as a CREATE INDEX.

In the example below a unique index is added to the table (t2) inserted into by the trigger's action statement. When the tirgger fires it does not raise any error (should raise a unique constraint violated error) and does not insert the value into the index. A select from t2 does not show the additional rows in t2 as it is performing an index scan, once the index is dropped the rows appear to the select.
