It would be nice if sysinfo printed out more specific jvm information that is provided with java -version. At least with the IBM jvm the system  properties java.runtime.version and java.fullversion give some more (but not all) information.   More research is needed across multiple jvms to tie it down.  Alternatively sysinfo could dump all the system property information, but that could make the output pretty big and show irrelavant information in some contexts.
