Noticed two privileged blocks in NetworkServerControlApiTest that could be simplified:


	privInetAddressGetByName() tests whether the PrivilegedActionException wraps a SecurityException. PAE only wraps checked exceptions, and SecurityException is an unchecked exception, so that can never happen.




	fileExists() could use the existing helper method PrivilegedFileOpsForTests.exists() and remove its privileged block.
