perform some work in a local transaction without committing and then start a global transaction.

Embedded throws an XAException with

XAER_OUTSIDE - The resource manager is doing work outside a global transaction.

Client throws an XAEception with

XAER_RMFAIL  -  Resource manager is unavailable

Seems like embedded has the correct error code, though I don't have the XA spec in front of me.
