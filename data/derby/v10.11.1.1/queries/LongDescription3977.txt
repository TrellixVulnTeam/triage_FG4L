Calling Clob.truncate with a value that is greater then the Clob length raises different SQLExceptions in the client and the embedded driver.
 o Client: SQLState.BLOB_LENGTH_TOO_LONG - XJ079
 o Embedded: SQLState.BLOB_POSITION_TOO_LARGE - XJ076

I believe the fix is simple enough  - change one of the exceptions.
Which one most closely describes the situation?

A release note is needed for this fix.

Also note the following from the Java API docs:
"void truncate(long len)
              throws SQLException

    Truncates the CLOB value that this Clob designates to have a length of len characters.

    Note: If the value specified for pos is greater then the length+1 of the CLOB value then the behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw a SQLException while other drivers may support this operation.
"

This opens for a change of behavior as well.
There seems to an inconsistency in the docs, possibly due to rephrasing - it references both len and pos. The latter isn't used anywhere else in the JavaDoc for truncate.
And what should the result of truncate(length+1) be?
