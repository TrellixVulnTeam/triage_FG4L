In 64 bit windows vista OS, if an executable is 32 bit than it is generally installed under 
"C:\Program Files (x86)" folder. The brackets in the path cause problems while connecting
to any database stored in that folder(in jar format) through derby JDBC.

The effective connection string is :
jdbc:derby:jar:(C:/Program Files(86)/ClassicModels.jar)ClassicModels 
This fails because the closing brackets is not escaped. 

I looked into the documentation and didn't find references to escaping the brackets in the path. 
I think this problem should be reproducible on all platforms.




you cannot connect to it,
