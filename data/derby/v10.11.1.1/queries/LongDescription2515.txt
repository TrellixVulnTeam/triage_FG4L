 If I set a INOUT parameter to a value (say 12.3) and it gets 
modified by the procedure to another value (say 45.6) then on 
the next execution
     of the same CallableStatement, embedded maintains the 
current value (45.6), while network server reverts to the 
former value (12.3).  

This issue was found while converting the test lang/procedure.java.  See references to this issue in the converted LangProcedureTest.java
