If an application does the following:

rs.updateInt(1, newValueCol1);
rs.updateRow();
rs.updateInt(2, newValueCol2);
rs.cancelRowUpdates();

Then, when calling rs.getInt(1), it will return the old value. Instead it should return the new value.

Workaround: after calling rs.updateRow(), the application could call rs.relative(0).

This problem does not affect forward only resultsets, since after an updateRow() they get positoned before the next row, leaving it impossible to do anything with the current row.
