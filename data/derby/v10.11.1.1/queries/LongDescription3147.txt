Various code in DataDictionaryImpl, LanguageConnectionContext and elsewhere provide some logic to allow regular SQL identifiers to be lower-cased instead of upper-cased, however the code is basically unused and not fully implemented.

Since Derby uses the SQL standard upper-casing for regular identifiers this code just adds footprint and makes the methods that parse identifiers harder to read.
