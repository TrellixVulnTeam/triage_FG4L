When running with client side tracing enabled, these lines appear first in the trace file:

[derby] BEGIN TRACE_DRIVER_CONFIGURATION
[derby] Driver: Apache Derby Network Client JDBC Driver 10.8.0.0 alpha - (1075248P)
[derby] Compatible JRE versions: 
{ 1.3, 1.4 }

The list of compatible JRE versions is wrong. The client driver doesn't work on 1.3, and 1.5 and 1.6 are missing from the list.
