I happened to notice that some of the links in the documentation are broken.

For example, on http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.9/devguide/cdevconcepts50894.html
the link to LockTable API documentation is broken.

There are also broken links to the documentation in the wiki, but that's not something we track with JIRA issues, I think. But it would be nice to figure out if we can clean up those links easily. For example, on  http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/LockDebugging there are broken links to the LockTable API documentation, as well as to the SYSCS_DIAG table documentation.
