The 10.2.1.6 release notes said:

"New scripts have been added in the bin directory which follow Apache conventions. The scripts in the frameworks directory are deprecated and may be removed in future releases."

DERBY-1709 added a warning message in the scripts in the frameworks/ directory, as well as a textual file (frameworks.DEPRECATED.txt) in the root of the installation tree warning that the frameworks/ directory has been deprecated and that scripts in the bin/ directory should be used instead. This was committed after the 10.2.2.0 release, to both the trunk and the 10.2 branch (before the 10.3 branch was created).

The presence of both a frameworks/ directory and a bin/ directory is annoying to some users, and confusing to others. There is obviously a balance to keep between pleasing such users and other users who want backwards compatibility.

Perhaps the next feature release (10.4?) is the right time to remove the frameworks/ directory once and for all, since deprecation warnings have been issued for the past two feature releases (10.2 and 10.3, though stronger in 10.3 than 10.2), giving users time to adjust.

Marking "Release Note Needed" since it is important to make such changes visible to users.
This change may affect existing applications that are still using the deprecated scripts in the frameworks/ directory.
