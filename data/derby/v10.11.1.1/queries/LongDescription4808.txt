Our junit tests are written in such a way that we avoid false failures because of absence of optional pieces of software.
This is convenient when developers want to do a 'quick' test run. 

However, it's not so good when we think we're running with all optional pieces in place, but something's (gone) missing; we'll not see it and it may go unnoticed for a long time. We should get warned about missing pieces when we want all tests to run.

One suggestion was to put some kind of check in the test org.apache.derbyTesting.junit.EnvTest.
