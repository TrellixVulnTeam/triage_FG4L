DirFile4.getOutputStream(boolean) does not restrict the file permissions on the file if it ends up creating a new file.

This method is only used for writing to BACKUP.HISTORY during backup. The BACKUP.HISTORY file in the backup does have restricted file permissions, it is only the file in the original database that is created with less restrictive permissions.
