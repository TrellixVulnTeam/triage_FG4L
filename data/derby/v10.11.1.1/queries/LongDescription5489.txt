When ResultSet.getObject(int) is called on a BLOB column, the correct EmbedBlob object is returned. But if afterwards the ResultSet.getBytes(int) is called on the same row, the returned array contains invalid data - it is offset by 3 bytes and its size is incorrect.
The problem only occurs when the stored BLOB is large enough to be internally represented by stream and not by array of bytes (at least ~32KiB).
It seems that the getObject method shifts the stream position and therefore the getBytes method starts to read the data after the third byte, thus incorrectly calculating its length.
