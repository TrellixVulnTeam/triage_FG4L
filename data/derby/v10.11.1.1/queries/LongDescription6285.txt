InternalDriver creates a thread pool for running timed logins like this:

    private static final ThreadPoolExecutor _executorPool =
            new ThreadPoolExecutor(0, Integer.MAX_VALUE, 60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
                                   new SynchronousQueue<Runnable>());
    static 
{
        _executorPool.setThreadFactory(new DaemonThreadFactory());
    }

The java.util.concurrent.Executors class has factory methods that create thread pools and hide the details such as choosing keep-alive time and which kind of queue to use.
