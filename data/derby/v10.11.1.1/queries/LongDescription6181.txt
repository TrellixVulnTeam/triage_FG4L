This test is currently disabled by DERBY-6178 when a non-default base port is specified.  It would be nice if it could run
in the nightly regression runs where multiple suites.all are run using differen base ports.

This test currently spawns a new process to test auto loading.  I think the changes necessary are:
1) get the non-default baseport over to the spawned process.  I think you can add a -D argument to 
    the spawn command for this.
2) change the code that starts a network server to use the new baseport.
