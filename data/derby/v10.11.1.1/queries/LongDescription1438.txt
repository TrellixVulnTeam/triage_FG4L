The first part of the string written by SQLExeption.toString() differs
between the Derby client driver and the embedded driver. The embedded
driver writes:

   SQL Exception: Table/View 'DERBYDB' does not exist.

while the client driver writes:

   java.sql.SQLException: Table/View 'DERBYDB' does not exist.

It would be good if we changed this so the same text is written by
both drivers. This reduces the difference seen when changing between
client and embedded Derby and it make it possible to reduce the amount
of sed-ing or the number of master file variants for some tests.
