The attached program DoubleSelect selects a blob column twice and tries to access the blob column with getBinaryStream.


With embedded the output is:
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
I am done

Two things seem to be happening with embedded.
1) Both getBinaryStream() calls are returning the same stream.
2) The second getBinaryStream() call throws away 4 bytes.


With client the output is:
Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: The object is already
closed.
        at
org.apache.derby.client.am.CloseFilterInputStream.read(CloseFilterInputStream.java:50)
        at DoubleSelect.printNextTen(DoubleSelect.java:53)
        at DoubleSelect.main(DoubleSelect.java:43)
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
So with client it looks like the  second getBinaryStream() call closes
the first stream but then returns the right result for the second stream.

Perhaps embedded should behave the same as client or perhaps the query should just work.  Regardless embedded should not return wrong results.
