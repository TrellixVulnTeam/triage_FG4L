The small device platform we support based on CDC/Foundation 1.1 does not support the NIO based method used by Derby to guarantee against dual boots of a database by different VMs. It would be nice to have a way to guarantee against this scenario.

Currently, one would have to use the property derby.database.forceDatabaseLock with the ensuing hassle of cleaning away orphaned lock files.
The default behavior is "false", so then all Derby does if to print a warning to derby.log and System.err.

Cf discussion in 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-4179?focusedCommentId=12864945&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12864945

Apparently this is not an issue on the Windows platform.
