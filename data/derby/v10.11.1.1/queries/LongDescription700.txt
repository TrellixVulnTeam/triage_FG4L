Derby does not prevent dual boot from two different classloaders on Linux and Mac OS X.


To reproduce run the  program DualBootRepro with no derby jars in your classpath. The program assumes derby.jar is in 10.1.2.1/derby.jar, you can change the location by changing the DERBY_LIB_DIR variable.

On Linux the output is:

$java -cp . DualBootRepro
Loading derby from file:10.1.2.1/derby.jar
10.1.2.1/derby.jar
Booted database in loader java.net.URLClassLoader@8ed465
FAIL: Booted database in 2nd loader java.net.URLClassLoader@dc6a77


On Windows I get the expected output.
$ java -cp . DualBootRepro
Loading derby from file:10.1.2.1/derby.jar
10.1.2.1/derby.jar
Booted database in loader java.net.URLClassLoader@1ac04e8
PASS: Expected exception for dualboot:Another instance of Derby may have already booted the database D:\marsden\repro\dualboot\mydb.
