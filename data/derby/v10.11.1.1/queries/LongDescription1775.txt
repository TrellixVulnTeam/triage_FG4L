Derby's text for 2200M is as below, probably should start out being more generic. Also based upon past error messages like this ('see next for details') it's probably best to include the text of the next message in the first, while continuing to chain them.

Consider replacing:

ERROR 2200M: Failed to parse XMLPARSE operand; see next exception for details.
ERROR XJ001: Java exception: 'Element type "idtwo" must be followed by either at
tribute specifications, ">" or "/>".: org.xml.sax.SAXException'.

with

ERROR 2200M: Invalid XML DOCUMENT : Element type "idtwo" must be followed by either at
tribute specifications, ">" or "/>".: org.xml.sax.SAXException'.
ERROR XJ001: Java exception: 'Element type "idtwo" must be followed by either at
