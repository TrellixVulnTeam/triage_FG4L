When running the test lang/wisconsin.java on zOS the output in the .tmp file shows non-native characters.
However, this is most likely a test/test harness specific problem, for if one executes the simple statistics gathering commands through ij, there is no problem. Note that other tests do produce readable (native) output.

It's impossible to tell if there is any actual problem this way.
