NetworkServerControlImpl has some constructs like this one:

    if (logWriter != null)
    {
        synchronized(logWriter) 
{
            logWriter.println(msg);
        }
    }

Since logWriter might be set to null after the test for logWriter!=null and before synchronized(logWriter), one might get a NullPointerException. It would be safer to write this instead:

    PrintWriter lw = logWriter;
    if (lw != null) {
        synchronized (lw) 
{
            lw.println(msg);
        }
    }
