The javadoc for PreparedStatement.setNull(int, int) says:
http://download.java.net/jdk6/docs/api/java/sql/PreparedStatement.html#setNull(int,%20int)

Throws:
 ...
    SQLFeatureNotSupportedException - if sqlType is a ARRAY, BLOB, CLOB, DATALINK, JAVA_OBJECT, NCHAR, NCLOB, NVARCHAR, LONGNVARCHAR, REF, ROWID, SQLXML or STRUCT data type and the JDBC driver does not support this data type

Since Derby doesn't support ARRAY, DATALINK, NCHAR, NCLOB, NVARCHAR, LONGNVARCHAR, REF, ROWID, SQLXML or STRUCT the method should throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException if used with any of these types. Currently, a general type conversion exception is thrown. With the client driver, no exception is thrown when using this method with the unsupported types.
