Simple repro as follows:

create table t1 (i int, j int);
insert into t1 values (1, 1), (1, -1), (2, 2), (3, -3), (4, 4);

create view v1 as select j, i from t1;
create view v2 (x,y,z) as select j, i, i+j from t1;

– OK: Returns column names specified in AS clause.
select * from t1 as x(a,b);

– OK: Returns column names for the views
select * from v1;
select * from v2;

– WRONG: Ignores column names specified in AS clause for the views.
select * from v1 x(a,b);
select * from v2 as x(a,b,c);

I observed this as far back as 10.0.2.1, so this is not a regression.
