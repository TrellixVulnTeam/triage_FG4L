DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() returns an extra column for a view with a group by and an expression in the select list.  I will attach the reproduction. Run the script create.sql and then the program ViewTest.

This is a regression in version 10.3, It ran ok on latest on the 10.1 and 10.2 branches.

The ResultSetMetaData appears to return the correct number of columns  when you select from the view, but it would be nice to add a regression test for that too.

See discussion on derby-dev.
