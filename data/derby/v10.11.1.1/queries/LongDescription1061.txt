stored procedure is used to fetch localised message in net work client
because of issue 1059 the call to the stored prcedures fails resulting in SqlException. When  SqlException.getSQLException, to set exceptionThrownOnStoredProcInvocation_, is called it again results in a call to SqlException.getMessage which call Sqlca.getJDBCMessage. 
The cycle repeats and finally ends up with StackOverfilowError

fixing 1059 will solve this problem temporarily but some other situaltion may cause it again.

Isuggest seting SqlException itself to exceptionThrownOnStoredProcInvocation_ to break this loop.
