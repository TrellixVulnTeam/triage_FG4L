The javadoc for org.apache.derby.iapi.services.cache.CacheFactory.newCacheManager() describes the initialSize parameter like this:

		@param initialSize	The number of initial holder objects that will be created

And org.apache.derby.impl.services.cache.Clock's constructor says the following:

		@param initialSize the initial number of cachable object this cache
		holds.
		@param maximumSize the maximum size of the cache.  The cache may grow
		from initialSize to maximumSize if the cache policy notices that there
		is not enough free buffers availiable.  Once the cache hits maximumSize
		it will not grow.  If the cache is full, an exception will be thrown

However, when Clock is created, it does not populate the cache with "holder objects" or "cacheable [objects]". It only uses the initialSize to specify the initial capacity of the HashMap and the ArrayList that are created.

Either the code should be changed so that it's in line with the comments, or the comments should be changed to match the code. I don't see any compelling reason for changing the code, so I think I would prefer changing the comments.
