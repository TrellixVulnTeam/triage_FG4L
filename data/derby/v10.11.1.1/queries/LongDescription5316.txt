After we're done testing an old version in the upgrade tests, its classes are still loaded in the JVM because the old driver is referenced in DriverManager. We should find a way to unload the old drivers so that the memory usage of the upgrade tests is reduced. Now we typically need to run with -XX:MaxPermSize=200M or similar options to work around this issue.
