The JDBC method 'setAsciiStream' uses different encodings for embedded and client. In the embedded driver, "ISO-8859-1" is used, in the client driver "US-ASCII" is used. The former is 8-bit, the latter is 7-bit. According to JDBC, the 8-bit encoding should be used for ASCII (see http://db.apache.org/derby/papers/JDBCImplementation.html#GetAsciiStream%28%29 ).

The method 'getAsciiStream' should also be made to match in the two drivers.
