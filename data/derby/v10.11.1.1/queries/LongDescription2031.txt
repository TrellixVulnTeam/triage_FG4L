testProtocol.java executes DRDA commands from a file written in a special-purpose language. The statements are very much like assertions, so it should be fairly easy to convert the test to JUnit.

Suggested approach: Change the interpreter (TestProto.java) so that is uses Assert.fail() instead of System.err.println() and System.exit(), and BaseTestCase.println() instead of System.out.println(). It should also use TestConfiguration to get the host name and port number.
