An IBM copyright is in these files:

derby/code/trunk/tools/jar/copyright.txt
derby/code/branches/10.1/tools/jar/copyright.txt
derby/code/branches/10.0/tools/jar/copyright.txt

'svn log' shows it was part of the original code contribution â€“ I think this was just missed in the copyright cleanup.

There also exists reference to CPL in

java\drda\org\apache\derby\impl\drda\EbcdicCcsidManager.java(22): http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/CPLv1.0.htm
