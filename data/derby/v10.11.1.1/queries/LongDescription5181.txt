The top-level RELEASE-NOTES.html file uses the <blockquote> tag to indent the text. This looks nice and improves readability, but it violates the WCAG accessibility guideline 3.7, which says, 

"Mark up quotations. Do not use quotation markup for formatting effects such as indentation."

You can use a CSS stylesheet for formatting, however.
