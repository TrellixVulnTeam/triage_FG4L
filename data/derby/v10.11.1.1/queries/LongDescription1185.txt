Right now messages that are deemed network client specific are placed manually in clientmessages.properties.  This is a JIRA for moving these messages to messages.properties and using splitmessages.java to copy over the messages the client needs to clientmessages.properties at build time.  The goal is to reduce the overall complexity of adding messages to the client,and also to help ensure that messages across client and embedded drivers are consistent and coherent.
