If you start the network server with the -ssl option and no <sslmode> argument, the server will be started in plain text mode.

For example:

java -jar derbynet.jar start -ssl

If -ssl is specified without <sslmode>, I would have expected that SSL was enabled (not sure which SSL mode, basic or peerAuthentication, is more appropriate) or that the command failed because of the missing argument. Treating "-ssl" as an alias for "-ssl off" sounds unintuitive to me.
