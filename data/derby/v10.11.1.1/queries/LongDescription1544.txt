Upgrading a database from 10.1 to 10.2 should automatically change database owner, recorded as owner of system schemas in sysschemas, from pseudo user 'DBA' to authorizationID of the user attempting upgrade. 

Another upgrade change I am thinking about is to grant execute privilege to 5 system routines that by default have execute privilege to public when a new database is created. Five system routines, two compress routines and three statistics related routines are given execute privilege to public when a new 10.2 database is created. This is not done when a 10.1 database is upgraded to 10.2 and probably good to include these privileges during database upgrade.
