Some tests are very sensitive to changes in pre-fetching, either
because they call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS() which
displays the number of rows seen, or because a failure that normally
is exposed when calling ResultSet.next() is exposed when calling
Statement.execute().

Most of these tests are not testing when or how much data is
pre-fetched. If we make the tests less sensitive to pre-fetching, it
is easier to catch the real regressions when changing the way Derby is
pre-fetching data. Also, patches in that area of the code will be
smaller (fewer test changes) and easier to review.
