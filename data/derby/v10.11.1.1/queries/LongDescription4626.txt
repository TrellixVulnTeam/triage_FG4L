When setting the value of a VARCHAR parameter with setTimestamp() the timestamp is truncated to microsecond resolution if a calendar is specified. Nanosecond resolution is preserved when a calendar is not specified. These two methods should behave the same way. Since Derby supports nanosecond resolution, the timestamps should not be truncated.
