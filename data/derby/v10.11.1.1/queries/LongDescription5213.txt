An uncommitted TRUNCATE TABLE command does not block online backup. We should verify that the online and backed up databases are both in a consistent state. At a minimum, we should test the following:

o uncommitted truncate table followed by online backup and then access the backup copy and access the table.  should see the old data.
o uncommitred truncate table, followed by online backup that keeps logs,
  then commit the truncate, and then access the table in the backup.
