When invoking a stored procedure using Statement.executeUpdate(), the
client driver and the embedded driver behave differently.

If the stored procedure does not return any result set, the embedded
driver returns 0, whereas the client returns -1.

If the stored procedure returns one or more result sets, the embedded
driver returns -1, whereas the client fails with an exception.
