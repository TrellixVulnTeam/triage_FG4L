Turning on the istat daemon increases the risk of problems which arise when a database shuts down in the middle of collecting index statistics. There is concern that this increased risk could be significant. A consensus has developed that the istat daemon should not run by default in 10.8.1. For the shutdown-related problem, see DERBY-5108. For the community discussion of the risk to 10.8.1, see this email thread: http://old.nabble.com/opinions-on-a-less-aggressive-release-of-the-istats-feature--to31129980.html#a31143697

This issue tracks the work needed to turn off the istat daemon (by default) in 10.8.1 but re-enable it as the default on the trunk.
