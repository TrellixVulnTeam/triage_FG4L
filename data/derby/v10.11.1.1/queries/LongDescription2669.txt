If a user specifies a create database url like following
jdbc:derby:abcDB;create=true;collation=TERRITORY_BASED
we should ignore the collation attribute because no territory attribute has been specified. The current Derby 10.3 code does not do that. Once this is fixed, we should add a test case for it in CollationTest.java
