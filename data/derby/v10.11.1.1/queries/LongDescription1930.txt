The information in Derby's JDBC implementation notes needs to be in the documentation.
http://db.apache.org/derby/papers/JDBCImplementation.html

At least one approach is to add it to the published Javadoc in the package.html for org.apache.derby.jdbc.

This will make it easier for people to update and ensures that users of Derby have the information with a release.
