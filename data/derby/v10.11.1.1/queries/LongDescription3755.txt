ij's help command shows the syntax of GET CURSOR as:

GET [SCROLL INSENSITIVE] CURSOR name AS 'SQL-J query';
                               – gets a cursor (JDBC result set) on the query
                               – SCROLL cursors are only available 
                               – in JDBC 2.0 and higher. 
                               – (Cursor scroll type is ignored in JDBC 1.X.) 

One can actually also specify holdability, so the syntax show read:

GET [SCROLL INSENSITIVE] [HOLD | NOHOLD] CURSOR name AS 'SQL-J query';

and the comment should also state that HOLD is the default.
