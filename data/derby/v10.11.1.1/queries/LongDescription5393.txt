The initial mechanism to purge in-memory databases has been deprecated and should be removed. Since it was never properly documented, and the text on the wiki came with warnings that it can be removed at any time, I plan to just remove it in 10.9 without further ado.

The wiki should be updated when this has been done. There's nothing to change in the Derby documentation.
