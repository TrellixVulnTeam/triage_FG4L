The following sequence of steps causes a sequence generator to return the same value on successive NEXT VALUE FOR calls.

1) Bring up ij and issue the following commands:

connect 'jdbc:derby:db;create=true';

create sequence s;
values next value for s; 

2) Control-c out of ij so that the engine comes down hard without an orderly shutdown.

3) Now bring up ij again and issue the following commands:

connect 'jdbc:derby:db';

values next value for s; 

Thanks to Knut for finding this one.
