The classes utilMain and utilMain14 contain utility methods for manipulating the holdability of a connection or a statement. There is one implementation for JDBC 2.0 JVMs and one implementation for JDBC 3.0 JVMs. Since Derby now only supports JVMs which support JDBC 3.0 (or JSR-169 which is a subset of JDBC 3.0), we could move code from utilMain14 to utilMain and delete utilMain14. The class Main14 behaves identically to the class Main, except that it returns utilMain14 instances, so once the utilMain14 class is removed, Main14 can be removed as well.
