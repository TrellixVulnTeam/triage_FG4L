When investigating DERBY-3312 I found out that performance with the embedded driver has decreased a lot as well.
Analysis on trunk indicate excessive memory usage, causing high allocation and garbage collection costs.

I believe there was another major performance problem in 10.3, but it appears fixed in trunk. I have not spent time identifying this problem.
