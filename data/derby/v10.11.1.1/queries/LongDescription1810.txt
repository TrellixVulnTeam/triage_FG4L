In my environment derbynet/testProperties has started to fail every time I run it, previously it failed occasionally.  Increasing the timeout
makes it run in my enviroment so I am going to submit  a fix to do that.  I am filing a separate issue from DERBY-1694, as all I am going
to do is increase the timeout.  The test still has bad error handling that results in the test hanging forever if it fails, thus holding up execution
of a nightly test run.
