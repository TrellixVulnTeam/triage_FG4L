In DERBY-1046 Knut made the following suggestion:

Perhaps we could just remove that [JRE/JDBC] line from the sysinfo output to avoid having to maintain duplicated code? Before, it used to tell exactly what Derby recognized the current platform as and which JDBC level it was running at. Now, it just tells what sysinfo thinks the engine recognized the platform as, and that information could just as easily and reliably be taken directly from the Java Information section of the sysinfo output.

This is the solution in trunk, but the 10.8 fix for DERBY-1046 keeps the line. Creating this subtask to track the difference in sysinfo output separately.
