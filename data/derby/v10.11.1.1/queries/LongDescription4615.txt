The getDate(), getTime() and getTimestamp() methods in EmbedCallableStatement ignore the Calendar argument, and therefore give the wrong results if some other calendar than the default calendar is passed in. The client driver seems to do the right thing, though.

Also note that none of these methods are ever called by any of the regression tests.
