DDMReader.readBytes(int length) checks the length vs DssConstants.MAX_DSS_LENGTH, but ignores the fact that the buffer position "pos" might not be 0. If pos is non-zero then the pos + length can be larger than the size of "buffer" causing an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

For me this happened when sending a BLOB that was 32766 bytes long. The value of pos was 2 in that method.
