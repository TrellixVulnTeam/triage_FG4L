The generation clause is allowed to have a call to the ROW_NUMBER function. But it fails when a new row is inserted. It should be disallowed in CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN.


ij> create table t (x int generated always as (row_number() over ()));
0 rows inserted/updated/deleted
ij> insert into t values default;
ERROR XJ001: Java exception: 'ASSERT FAILED cannot get interface without operand: org.apache.derby.shared.common.sanity.AssertFailure'.
