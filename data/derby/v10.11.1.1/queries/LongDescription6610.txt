suites.All no longer runs cleanly for me when I run with just classes.
It still runs fine with jars.
We accepted this behavior at some point, but it is frustrating when you want to 'quickly' run tests while still working on some details.

One of the tests that failed for me was lang.DatabaseClassLoadingTest (complaining about one of the databases not found), another was lang.LuceneSupportPermsTest.
If a test cannot run cleanly with classes, it should get skipped (preferably both in the test itself and from the _Suite in which it is included).
I also think some of the network server tests complain if derbynet.jar is not found - I cannot off-hand remember if this causes the test to fail.
