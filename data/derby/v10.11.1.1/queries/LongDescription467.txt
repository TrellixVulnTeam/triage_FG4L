In looking at the privilged blocks in Derby  several are accessible from application code, either as in public/protected methods and public classes. The fix for this includes:


	making packages in the jar files sealed wherever possible
	making classes and methods with privilged blocks  as private as possible (private or package for methods, package for classes)



As Derby moves towards a more client server approach (e.g. see grant/revoke) I started to perform a security analysis of the priviliged blocks, but realised it would be easier if I fixed the obvious problems first.
