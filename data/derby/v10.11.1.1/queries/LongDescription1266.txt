This fragment from deleteRowX shows the problem:

> if (isOnInsertRow_) 
{
>       throw new SqlException(agent_.logWriter_, 
>           new MessageId(SQLState.CURSOR_NOT_POSITIONED_ON_INSERT_ROW));
> }

It should be the opposite: the problem is that the cursor is on the
insert row, not that it isn't.

These is a similar error in updateRowX.

The client master files for updatableResultSet show the problem, so
the masters are wrong, too.
