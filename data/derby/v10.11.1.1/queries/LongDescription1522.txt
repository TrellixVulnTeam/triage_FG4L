There has been discussions on the Derby-dev list about switch from Derby Authorization to Derby SQL Standard Authorization for existing databases. If we do decide to support a switch like that, testing needs to be done/added to make sure everything works fine after the switch.

ps I have added this JIRA entry to JDBC component but I am not 100% sure if that is the right component.
