Revoking a privilege on a table will currently cause the DependencyManager.invalidateFor() to be called on the table's TablePermsDescriptor with the action=REVOKE_PRIVILEGE. However, the prepared statements that refer to that table are dependents of the table's TableDescriptor, but NOT its TablePermsDescriptor, so the statements are not invalidated after revoke.

This problem is currently hidden by the fact that authorization is checked on every execution, but this will change when language result sets are no longer reused (see DERBY-827).
