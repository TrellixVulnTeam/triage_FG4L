The only operation currently allowed on BOOLEAN columns is to select them from the system tables. For instance, the following query selects BOOLEAN values:

    select systemalias from sys.sysaliases;

There are discrepancies in how the embedded and client drivers handle these BOOLEAN columns. The embedded behavior is correct and the client behavior should conform. I will attach a spec describing what needs to be done.
