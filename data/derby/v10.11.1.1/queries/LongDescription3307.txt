If a null reference is passed in to one of the ClientPooledConnection.addXEventListener, a NPE will be thrown if an event occurs.
I will attach a simple repro as a patch to the test jdbc4.StatementEventsTests. I believe the situation is the same for connection event listeners.

I have found no information in the specs regarding null listeners, but I assume it would be okay to ignore them.
