My IDE shows many warnings in the classes under impl/sql because they are public and may make parts of the internal state more visible than necessary. I'd like to reduce the visibility of classes and methods, if possible, to make it clearer to IDEs and tools that perform static analysis that the code is only accessed from the same package, and reduce some of the noise from the tools.
