The ant release target  on Windows  creates release.properties with inconsistent line endings that prevent checkin.


This may be a configuration issue.  I have *.properties = svn:eol-style=native which I think is correct but I could not diff or checkin the file until I removed the dos line endings.  There are similar issues with the release notes but because they are not checked in as part of the a script we document how to fix them up.
