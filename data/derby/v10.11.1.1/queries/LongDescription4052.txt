The last line of SQLChar.copyState() looks incorrect.

        this.localeFinder = localeFinder;

This line doesn't do anything, since the left side and the right side of the assignment are identical.

It might be intentional, but in that case there should be a comment explaining why. Looking at the rest of the method, it looks like the intention is that the right side of the assignment should be other.localeFinder.
