I am seeing the following diff in XATest, in a clean subversion client running under DerbyNetClient framework on jdk14 on either Linux or cygwin/xp:

52a53
> (1 |PREPARED |false |APP |UserTransaction
54d54
< (1 |PREPARED |false |APP |UserTransaction
Test Failed.

	
	
		
		
			End:   XATest jdk1.4.2_08 DerbyNetClient 2006-08-03 13:06:22 ***
		
		
	
	



Looks like an ordering instability.
