For the sql script below:

create table t1(c11 int, c12 int);

– insert data into tables
insert into t1 values(1,1);
insert into t1 values(2,2);

– set autocommit off
autocommit off;

get with nohold cursor jdk1 as 'SELECT * FROM t1';

– do fetches from the cursor
next jdk1;

--commit
commit;

– now try the fetch on cursor again after commit
– cursors jdk1 will give Error XCL16
next jdk1;

– clean up.
close jdk1;

for the line "next jdk1;", an Error XCL16 will be thrown. However, detailed prompt for Error XCL16 is different between Client and Embed.
In client mode, we get "ERROR XCL16: ResultSet not open.  Verify that autocommit is OFF."
While, in embed mode, we get "ERROR XCL16: ResultSet not open. Operation 'next' not permitted. Verify that autocommit is OFF."
