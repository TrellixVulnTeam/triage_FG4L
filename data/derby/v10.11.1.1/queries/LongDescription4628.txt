When talking about locales, the Derby user guides employ a piece of jargon which Java programmers do not commonly use. The user guides speak about "territories" instead of "locales". Here, for instance, is a puzzling sentence from the section on the territory attribute in the Derby Reference Guide:

"When creating or upgrading a database, use this attribute to associate a non-default territory with the database."

What, a Java developer might ask, is a territory? Reading more material from that page, it may become apparent that a territory is nothing more or less than what the JDK's javadoc calls a locale. The possible values for the territory attribute are nothing more or less than the names of locales supported by the VM. Our discussion of language-sensitive issues would be clearer if we used the common term rather than our private jargon.

This jargon is used across the user guides. Correcting it would be a systemic change.
