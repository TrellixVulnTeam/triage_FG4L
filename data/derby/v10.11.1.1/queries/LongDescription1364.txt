When executing a stored procedure with executeQuery() and the proc
doesn't return exactly one result set, the query should fail and the
statement should be rolled back. Embedded does this correctly.

The client driver, however, does not roll back the statement, so the
effects of statements executed on nested connections in the stored
procedure are still visible. The reason for this is that the network
server executes the statement with execute() instead of
executeQuery(), so that it succeeds on the server. The client then
counts the number of result sets, and raises an exception if it is not
one, but it does not roll back the effects of the stored procedure.
verified that.)

The same problem exists for executeUpdate(). JCC also has these
problems.
