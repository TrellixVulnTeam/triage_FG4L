Derby properties can be specified as system properties, values stored in derby.properties, and values stored in the database via the syscs_set_database_property procedure. The rules for how these property sets interact are confusing. It would be good to provide users a way to figure out what Derby thinks a property is set to. Maybe we could provide a builtin or system function for this purpose.
