The connect statement in ij currently uses DriverManager class to get a connection and so does not work in J2ME environment. Currently in tests, the startJBMS method can optionally use DataSource to get a connection. This approach can be used in 'connect' statement too. This change will allow more tests to be run in J2ME.
