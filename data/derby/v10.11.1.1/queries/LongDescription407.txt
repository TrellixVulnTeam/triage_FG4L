The predicatesIntoViews test (part of the derbylang suite) fails when running the tests on a busy/slow system, but they pass when I run them on my fast Windows box.

It appears that the failure could be due to different optimizations being performed due to the difference in speed of the machines.  This needs to be confirmed that it is the case of the test failure.  I will attach the test summary to this issue.

I also noticed that the test report said 0% fail even though one test failed. 

All derbylang tests passed on Windows XP. 

Thanks,
