Sun JDBC defines getPrecision() to return either the maximum length or maximum number of digits of the column, or zero for failure (such as the precision is unknown).

The DATE field returns 10 characters on a getPrecision() call so why doesn't TIME and TIMESTAMP give a precision length equal to the display length? Just seems inconsistent that DATE would return a precision (as well as all other data types) and not TIME nor TIMESTAMP.
