Parts of the state of TestConfiguration has been made public, which they should not be; DEFAULT_PORT and DEFAULT_HOSTNAME.
Using these directly from the outside can cause settings overridden by the user to be ignored by tests. Further, a test should not care if the host/port it uses is the Derby default or the values set by the user running the test.

To obtain a hostname and  a port number, use the methods getPort and getHostName in TestConfiguration.
