Via a UNION query, it is possible to implicitly cast non-BOOLEAN types to BOOLEAN today. These implicit casts do not obey the SQL Standard rules defined in part 2, section 6.12 (<cast specification>). Derby should support the Standard rules.

The following query shows how you can implicitly cast a non-BOOLEAN data type to BOOLEAN today:

select isindex from sys.sysconglomerates where conglomeratename = 'foo'
union
values ( 1 )
