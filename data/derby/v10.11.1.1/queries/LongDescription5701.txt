UpdatableResultSetTest fails with an OutOfMemoryError in my environment when I run it with a 50 MB heap. Some of its test cases open close to 900 statements, and they leave many of the statements open till tearDown(). It would be good if the test cases cleaned up the open statements earlier to avoid these peaks in memory usage.
