Dan reports that BlobClob4BlobTest.tesPositionAgressive takes very long to run:
> In a test run (junit-all) of 5,816 fixtures that took 4124 seconds (~68mins) three fixtures took 53% of the total time.

> testNetworkServerSecurityMechanism    497.280 seconds
> testTypesInActionStatement            128.928 seconds 

Knut Anders reports that this behavior is fairly new:
> It seems like it started taking a lot more time at revision 530085. I had
