Additional work needs to be done for grant/revoke to make sure that only users with required privileges can access various database objects. In order to do that, first we need to collect the privilege requirements for various database objects and store them in SYS.SYSREQUIREDPERM. Once we have this information then when a user tries to access an object, the required SYS.SYSREQUIREDPERM privileges for the object will be checked against the user privileges in SYS.SYSTABLEPERMS, SYS.SYSCOLPERMS and SYS.SYSROUTINEPERMS. The database object access will succeed only if the user has the necessary privileges.

SYS.SYSTABLEPERMS, SYS.SYSCOLPERMS and SYS.SYSROUTINEPERMS are already populated by Satheesh's work on DERBY-464. But SYS.SYSREQUIREDPERM doesn't have any information in it at this point and hence no runtime privilege checking is getting done at this point.
