Implement a cache for storing JDBC prepared statement objects.
The cache will be responsible for holding free prepared statement objects that can be reused, and also to throw away objects if the cache grows too big.
All objects in the cache must belong to the same physical connection, but they can be reused across logical connections obtained from a single physical connection in a connection pool.

This component is probably a candidate for code sharing between the client and the embedded driver. Sharing will not  be part of this issue.
