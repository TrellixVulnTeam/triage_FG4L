Users have reported databases that will not boot with stack traces showing:
Caused by: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
at java.lang.System.arraycopy(Native Method)
at org.apache.derby.impl.store.raw.data.AllocPage.ReadContainerInfo(Unknown Source)
at org.apache.derby.impl.store.raw.data.FileContainer.readHeader(Unknown Source)

I suggest the code be changed to catch the out of bounds and turn it
into a StandardException and include as much runtime information as
possible so that the underlying problem can be diagnosed.  Information
should include sizes of both arrays, the amount of data being copied ("N"),
and possibly a hex dump of the source array.
