Attempting to get call Blob/Clob.length() after commit or connection close does not fail if there was a previous call to length().  If no previous call was made an exception is thrown as expected.

See attached program TestLobLength for repro with commit.  If you comment out the two lines to get the length before the commit we get the expected exception.
