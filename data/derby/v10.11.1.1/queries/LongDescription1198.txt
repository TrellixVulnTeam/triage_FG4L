During inspection for another problem, I noticed that StatementTest.java still uses SQLState.NO_CURRENT_CONNECTION.  SQLState is a private interface and should not be used in our tests.  This test  should instead use "08003" or better yet use the new SQLStateConstants class in the functiontests/util package, e.g. SQLStateConstants.CONNECTION_EXCEPTION_CONNECTION_DOES_NOT_EXIST
