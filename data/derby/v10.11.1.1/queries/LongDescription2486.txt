A sort is obtained through TransactionController.openSort() which returns a long, this is then used with various methods on TransactionController to get a SortController, get the scans against the sort and drop the sort.

This is not a natural OO style of programming, instead the open should return the SortController and then all actions on the sort including dropping be methods on SortController.

This would be cleaner and remove the logic in RAMTransaction that tries to re-uses long sort identifiers.
