The latest builds of JDK 7 at https://jdk7.dev.java.net/ have "Oracle Corporation" in the system property java.vendor. Since isSunJVM() only checks for "Sun Microsystems Inc.", some tests will be excluded on JDK 7 even if they would have worked. We should update isSunJVM() to return true for "Oracle Corporation" too.
