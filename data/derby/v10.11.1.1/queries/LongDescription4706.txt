The code in net.Request.writeEncryptedScalarStream() is in a bad state, for instance:

	it materializes the stream
	it doesn't support streams longer than Integer.MAX_VALUE
   (this is fine for BLOB since Derby limits the LOB size to 2G-1, but for CLOBs the data stream may be longer since the length is expressed in characters)
	in some error situations it causes a disconnect



Since the security mechanisms required to run this code (SECMEC_EUSRIDDTA and  SECMEC_EUSRPWDDTA) are apparently supported in the client but not in the network server, deleting it seems like a good option considering its state.
