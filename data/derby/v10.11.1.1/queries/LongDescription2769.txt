The error handling, or parameter checking, in Clob.subString is not adequate.
There are four parameters that can be invalid;

	pos
	str
	offset
	len



The first one is already handled properly, the remaining three are not. They typically result in some low-level exception like a NPE.
I have not found anything in the JDBC specification nor JavaDoc that dictates the behavior, except for that SQLException should use states defined in the SQL 2003 specification. A brief search there resulted in the following possibilities:
 22003 - numeric value out of range
 22004 - null value not allowed
 2200F - zero-length character string
 22011 - substring error 
 22023 - invalid parameter value

Some of these are already defined by Derby, but with unsuitable or very specific error messages.
