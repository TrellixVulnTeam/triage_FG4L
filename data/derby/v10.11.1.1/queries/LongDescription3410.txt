The test DataSourceTest is currently not run with JSR169, because the test includes calls to classes and methods that are not supported in that environment.
However, with JSR169 the only supported connection mechanism is a datasource, so it seems very hollowing to not even have this test run with JSR169.

I posted a question, asking if a split was a good idea (with an initial attempt), in thread:
