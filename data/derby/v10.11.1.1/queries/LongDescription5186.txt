On my AIX machine with ibm 1.4.2. the test dblook_test_territory.java fails consistently with this diff:

6169a6170
>       at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java(Compiled Code))

I've seen this during other test cycles, but never bothered reporting it.

functionTests.harness.Sed.java has this:
        deleteLines.addElement("^(.at .)(Compiled Code)$");
But apparently that's not matching the line put out by the jvm on AIX.
