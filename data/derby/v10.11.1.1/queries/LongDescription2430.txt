updateBlob(int columnIndex, Blob x), updateClob(int columnIndex, Clob x) can be implemented by forwarding calls to  setObject(int targetType, Blob source), setObject(int targetType, Clob source). If this this done then

1) updateClob on a CHAR/VARCHAR/LONG VARCHAR column throws an exception on the Embedded Driver but not on the NetworkClient
2) updateBlob works on a CHAR/VARCHAR/LONG VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA throws an exception on the Embedded Driver but not on the NetworkClient

From what the JDBC 4.0 spec says (pg 198 table b-5) the Embedded behaviour seems to be correct.

This can be fixed by Matching Embedded behaviour. This would involve throwing an exception in the cases mentioned above
