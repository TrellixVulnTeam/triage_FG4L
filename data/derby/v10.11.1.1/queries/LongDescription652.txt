Just a quick scan of the html files  in demo and docs directories of the 10.1.2.0 release candidate show incubator references in the following files.

./demo/demo.html
./demo/navbar.html
./docs/html/getstart/cgsinstallingderby.html
./docs/html/getstart/getstart-single.html
./docs/html/getstart/gsconrefs.html

Thanks to Naka for pointing this out.
I did not check the trunk and only checked the html files.  A more comprehensive check by someone used to working in this area would be good.
