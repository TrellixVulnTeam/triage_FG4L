Calling procedure SYSCS_BULK_INSERT  fails in 10.2 , throwing a syntax error when it sees the PROPERTIES clause.
SystemProcedures.SYSCS_BULK_INSERT uses the following sql query.
       String binsertSql =
           "insert into " + entityName +
           " PROPERTIES insertMode=bulkInsert " +
           "select * from new " + vtiName +
           "(" +
           "'" + schemaName + "'" + ", " +
           "'" + tableName + "'" +  ", " +
           "'" + vtiArg + "'" +  ")" +
           " as t";
I think because of the optimizer overrides in 10.2, this query does not work. 

Instead of the PROPERTIES clause, we should now use --DERBY-PROPERTIES.
