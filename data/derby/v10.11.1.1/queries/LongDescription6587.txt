There is a problem in org.apache.derby.impl.sql.execute.RIBulkChecker:

result = fkCol.compare(refCol);

            if (result == 1)
            {
                return GREATER_THAN;
            }
            else if (result == -1)
            {
                return LESS_THAN;
            }

where the JavaDoc for "compare" explicitly states that one must not use 1 or -1 to check the return value.

The problem can be reproduced when creating a table with two fields, "UUID_FIELD char (16) for bit data" and "NUM_FIELD integer", then having a foreign key to these two fields and then using the bulk import, i.e. "CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_IMPORT_TABLE ..."
