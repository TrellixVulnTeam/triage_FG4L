I tried
java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl  tracedirectory /tmp
and got:
Trace directory changed to /tmp.

java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl  trace on
Trace turned on for all sessions.
Trace turned on for all sessions.

And the trace output was not redirected to the /tmp directory. The tracedirectory command seemed to be ignored.

Setting tracedirectory with the system property derby.drda.traceDirectory or with the NetworkServerControl api seems to work ok.
