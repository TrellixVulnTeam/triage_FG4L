The addition of the StorageFactory code into the BaseMonitor code muddied the water with respect to what is a service and what is a storage factory.
Cleanup the code and add comments and/or a package.html to describe what is going on.
Look at loading the storage factories through the modules.properties rather than the hard-coded list and thus gain the benefit of the standard module environment
checking (jvm level and dependent classes) and ensure classes are loaded from modules.properties consistently.
