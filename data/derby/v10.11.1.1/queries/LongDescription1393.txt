From the javadoc:

Throws:
 ...
    SQLFeatureNotSupportedException - if targetSqlType is a ARRAY, BLOB, CLOB, DATALINK, JAVA_OBJECT, NCHAR, NCLOB, NVARCHAR, LONGNVARCHAR, REF, ROWID, SQLXML or STRUCT data type and the JDBC driver does not support this data type

Since Derby doesn't support ARRAY, DATALINK, NCHAR, NCLOB, NVARCHAR, LONGNVARCHAR, REF, ROWID, SQLXML or STRUCT the method should throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException if used with any of these types. Currently a general type conversion exception is thrown:

>>1) testSetObjectNotImplementedARRAY(org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.jdbc4.PreparedStatementTest)SQL Exception: An attempt was made to get a data value of type 'CLOB' from a data value of type '2003'.
>>Caused by: SQL Exception: An attempt was made to get a data value of type 'CLOB' from a data value of type '2003'.
