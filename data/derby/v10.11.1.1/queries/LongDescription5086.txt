The automatic index statistics daemon will by default log what it's doing. That means messages like these ones will be written to derby.log during normal operation:

Although these messages may be helpful in diagnosing bugs, they may also be a source of confusion since users probably only expect errors/problems to be logged by default. Also, for some workloads, large quantities of log may be produced and take up disk space. Therefore, I think we should disable the logging before the 10.8 release, and instead instruct users who experience problems to enable logging manually with the derby.storage.indexStats.log property.
