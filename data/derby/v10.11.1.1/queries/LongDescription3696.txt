The test "lang/longStringColumn.java" simply inserts a 65K characters long Java string into a Clob column and then retrieves it and compares it to the input.
I planned to convert it, but since our existing JUnit tests already cover this functionality, I propose to delete the old style test.

I'll wait a few days for feedback.
