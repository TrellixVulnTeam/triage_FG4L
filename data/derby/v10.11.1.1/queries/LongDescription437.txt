COMPRESS_TABLE procedure forms SQL statement undeneath,  so if  the user does not pass quoted names , it is not working with delimited table/schema names..

eg: create table "Order"(a int ) ;

ij> call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE('APP' , 'Order'  ,1) ;
ERROR 38000: The exception 'SQL Exception: Syntax error: Encountered "Order" at
line 1, column 17.' was thrown while evaluating an expression.
ERROR 42X01: Syntax error: Encountered "Order" at line 1, column 17.
With quoted names it works fine.
ij> call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE('APP' , '"Order"'  ,1) ;
0 rows inserted/updated/deleted

If  it is  expected that  user to pass quoted names for SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE, then it is ok.
But doc is not clear:

COMPRESS_TABLE doc in the reference manual:
TABLENAME
   An input argument of type VARCHAR(128) that specifies the table name
   of the table. The string must exactly match the case of the table
   name, and the argument of "Fred" will be passed to SQL as the
   delimited identifier 'Fred'. Passing a null will result in an error.

So either doc has to be fixed or code needs to be fixed to handle  quoted names for compress table.

I think the code has to fixed to be consistent with other system procedures. .  i.e
If you  created a schema, table or column name as a non-delimited identifier, you must pass the name in all upper case. If you created a schema, table or column name as a delimited identifier, you must pass the name in the same case as it was created.

For example:
create table "Order"(a int ) ;
call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE('APP' , 'Order'  ,1) ;

create table t1( a int ) 
call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE('APP' , 'T1'  ,1) ;
