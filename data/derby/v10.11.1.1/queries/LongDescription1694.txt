The testProperties.execCmd() is used to fork a JVM and not handle its
streams. This will cause problems, as indicated by the javadoc for Process.

"The parent process uses these streams to feed input to and get output
from the subprocess. Because some native platforms only provide limited
buffer size for standard input and output streams, failure to promptly
write the input stream or read the output stream of the subprocess may
cause the subprocess to block, and even deadlock"
