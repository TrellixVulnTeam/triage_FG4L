The call to the ResultSet method getBoolean() for a DECIMAL value throws data conversion exception with J2ME/CDC/Foundation. The class BigIntegerDecimal, which is used for DECIMAL support in J2ME/CDC/Foundation, does not override the getBoolean() method from the class DataType. The getBoolean() method in DataType simply throws a data conversion exception.
