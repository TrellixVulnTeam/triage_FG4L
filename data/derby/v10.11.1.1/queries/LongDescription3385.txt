DERBY-1387 implements a new feature set in Derby: Java Management eXtentions (JMX), i.e. standards-based management and monitoring capabilities.

As these are completely new features providing additional interfaces to a running Derby system, a set of functional regression tests should be added. The new tests should verify that Derby's public JMX API works as intended, and should be able to detect regressions in this area in the future. There is a functional specification (jmxFuncspec.html) attached to DERBY-1387 which may be used as reference.
