When the wrong keyword is used in a grant execute privilege statement, the error message
leads one the believe the identifier is neither a procedure or a function, when in deed it is one of the two.

> create function bc(i int) returns int language java parameter style java external name 'java.lang.Integer.bitCount' no sql;
> grant execute on procedure bc to foo;
ERROR 42Y03: 'BC' is not recognized as a function or procedure.

> grant execute on function bc to foo;
(works)

The reason is that the error message is generic. It would be better to have an error message for each case.
