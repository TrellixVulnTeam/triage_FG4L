This database metadata call will not  return SYNONYMS in the schema indicated.

rs = dmd.getTables((String) null, schema, (String) null,
                new String[] 
{"SYNONYM"}
);

Work around is to pass in null as the last argument and then test for each row

"SYNONYM".equals(rs.getString("TABLE_TYPE"))

Due to code in EmbedDatabasemetaData aorund line 1721 that assume the type character in SYS.SYSTABLES.TABLETYPE
is equal to the first character of the JDBC TABLE_TYPE name. This is true for views and tables, but in the Derby system table
the character 'S' is used for system tables and 'A' for SYNONYMS.
