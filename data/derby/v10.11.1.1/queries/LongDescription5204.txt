The HTML in the release notes doesn't pass the tests for HTML 4.01 Transitional at http://validator.w3.org. The problems are misplaced <p> tags:

1) The list of supported Java and JDBC is enclosed in a <p> ... </p> section. A paragraph cannot contain block-level elements, like unordered lists - <ul>.

2) The section that summarizes issues with release notes contains anchors with paragraphs nested inside them. Paragraphs cannot be nested inside anchors.
