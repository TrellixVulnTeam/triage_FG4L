Tuning guide for derby.locks.waitTimeout states it is a dynamic property, but when set as a system property using System.setProperty it does not change the timeout for any databases already booted. It might change it for databases that are booted after the change, I didn't test that.

If the property is set as a database property then it is dynamic, taking effect immediately.

Guess it affects all versions.
