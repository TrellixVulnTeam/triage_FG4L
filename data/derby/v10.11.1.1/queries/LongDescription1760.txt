I ran derbynetclientmats between two IPV6 machines with the 10.2 snapshot and finally got to look at the results...There were 8 failures, 4 of those because of other tests leaving stuff behind.
2 tests complained about junit classes not being found (? one of those was checkDataSource!).
2 tests seemed to have trouble connecting - those might be the more interesting ones.

Will do further analysis, & create test cleanup patches.

The failing tests and some comments:
suite derbynetclientmats with ibm142 & IPV6 machines using -DhostName= (i.e. remote server test) and build: 10.2.0.4 alpha - (419130)

derbynetclientmats/derbynetclientmats.fail:jdbcapi/checkDataSource.java
	?? fails because of an error accessing junit. Not sure why, junit is in client classpath...and it's not even a junit test. Stack trace not helpful. (points to client.am, which makes little/no sense).
