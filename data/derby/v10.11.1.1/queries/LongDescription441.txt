No comments on ClientDriver
Many protected/public  fields/methods appear in the published javadoc, but are not intended to be part of the api.
E.g. instance fields of ClientBaseDataSource, propertyKey constants in ClientBaseDataSource
Need to warn about conflicting attributes in connectionAttributes property (for Embedded as well)
