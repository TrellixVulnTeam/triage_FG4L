If a Java 6 JDK is detected by PropertySetter when compiling with a Java 5 compiler, the build break because classes with an unsupported class format version are pulled in.

PropertySetter already has code to fail the build or ignore the Java 6 libraries for IBM JDKs.

This issue is a straw man issue for the patch posted under DERBY-3989 (' derby-3989-02-aa-dontUseJava6LibsWithJava5Compiler.diff').
