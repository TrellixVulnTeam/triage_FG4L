While working on DERBY-4812, I noticed the following code in MasterReceiverThread,run().
I am not familiar enough with replication to know if the MasterReceiverThread can recover from such errors.  If it cannot i think it would better to have a clear failure at the time of the error than just a subsequent NullPointerException.
As the todo says, the exceptions should at least be logged.

Also I just noticed this one bit of code, so don't know if there are similar issues or TODO's elsewhere in replication code.


                } catch (SocketTimeoutException ste) 
{
                    // ignore socket timeout on reads
                }
 catch (ClassNotFoundException cnfe) 
{
                    // TODO: print problem to log
                }
 catch (IOException ex) 
{
                    // TODO: print problem to log
                    // If we get an exception for this socket, the log shipper
                    // will clean up. Stop this thread.
                    stopMessageReceiver = true;
                    msgReceiver = null;
                }
            }
