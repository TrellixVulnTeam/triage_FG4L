Provide a more full featured TestRunner for Derby testing.

junit.textui.TestRunner is not very robust. It does not for example print the tests as they run or print chained exceptions, create separate files for the full report and just failures.   It would be great to have a standardized TestRunner that everyone uses.  Perhaps someone already has one that they would like to contribute as a starter.
