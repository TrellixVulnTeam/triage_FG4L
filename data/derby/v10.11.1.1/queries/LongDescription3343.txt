The following series of statements fails:

j> connect 'jdbc:derby:test;create=true';
ij> create table t (id int primary key generated always as identity);
0 rows inserted/updated/deleted
ij> prepare p as 'insert into t(id) values (default)';
ij> execute p;
1 row inserted/updated/deleted
ij> execute p;
ERROR 23505: The statement was aborted because it would have caused a duplicate key value in a unique or primary key constraint or unique index identified by 'SQL080123140906700' defined on 'T'.
