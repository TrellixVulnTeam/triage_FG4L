The attached program TryTimeout.java should detect a deadlock but instead throws a lock timeout exception.  The program has two threads that attempt:


	    threadConnection.setAutoCommit(false);
	    /* set isolation level to repeatable read */
	    threadConnection.setTransactionIsolation(Connection.TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ);

	    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select * from t where i = 456");
	    while (rs.next());
	    stmt.executeUpdate("update t set i = 456 where i = 456");
	    threadConnection.commit();


This gives SQLState 40001 (deadlock) with DB2 but a lock timeout with Derby.
