When running some SQL queries through ij that fails it seems like some
information about chained exceptions is not presented to the user when
running with the client driver and jdk 1.6.


One example SQL that fails (taken from the ieptests.sql):
=========================================================

ij> call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_TABLE ('inventory', 'ORDERTABLE' ,
'extinout/order.dat', null, null, null) ;

When running this in ij the following error message is produced:



Java 1.6 Embedded driver:
=========================

ERROR 38000: The exception 'java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Schema
'inventory' does not exist' was thrown while evaluating an expression.
ERROR 42Y07: Schema 'inventory' does not exist


Java 1.5 Client driver:
=======================

ERROR 38000: The exception 'SQL Exception: Schema 'inventory' does not
exist' was thrown while evaluating an expression. SQLSTATE: 42Y07:
Schema 'inventory' does not exist


Java 1.6 Client driver:
=======================

ERROR 38000: The exception 'java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Schema
'inventory' does not exist' was thrown while evaluating an expression.


The bug (or difference) here is that the client driver when running
with jdk 1.6 does not print the chained exception and SQL state.
It would be nice to have the same information in the output as what is
written by the embedded driver (or client driver running with jdk
1.5).
