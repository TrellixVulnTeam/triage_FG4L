NetworkServerControl.start()  will not throw an exception  if another server is already running on the same port.    I am not sure but think perhaps this was changed at  one point to accomodate the derby.drda.startNetworkServer property  so that the embedded server could continue to boot even if the network server failed to start, but  I think this is wrong for normal usage.
