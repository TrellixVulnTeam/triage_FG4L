Error in initSlotTable() can cause NPE or ASSERT rather than reporting page number in corrupt page message.  The problem is
that depending on when the error is encountered we are in the middle of setting up a new page, so you can't use normal 
access routines for identifiying the page (like getIdentity() ) as they may not be set up yet.  

The fix is to change the error messages to use a passed in identity rather than counting on correct setup during initialization failure
