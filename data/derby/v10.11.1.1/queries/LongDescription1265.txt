I have seen an odd discrepancy in the UnsupportedVetter test when run on xp vs. linux against build 81 of jdk1.6. I have commented out the close() on the connection in connectionWorkhorse(). On xp this method succeeds. On linux it raises an Invalid Transaction State exception. My working theory is that the earlier call to vetObject(), which cycles through all the java.sql methods in an object and calls them one by one, ends up making the connection invalid (perhaps when calling Connection.close() itself). Why this happens on linux but not xp puzzles me.
