Almost every fixture ends up comping a large number of different statements of the form
    VALUES TAN(34.2)
    VALUES 
{fn TAN(34.2)}
with different "hrd-coded" values.

Switching to prepared statements with a parameter marker significantly improves the test running time.

Focus of the test is the math functions, not compilation.
