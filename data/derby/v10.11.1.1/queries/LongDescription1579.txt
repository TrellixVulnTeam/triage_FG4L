With the Grant Revoke functionality. Derby engine needs to keep track of view/constraint/trigger's dependencies on various privileges. SYS.SYSREQUIREDPERM table was added for this purpose. But these depdencies can be mantained using the existing Dependency Manager. I have done quite a bit of work using Dependency Manager for Grant Revoke and do not see a need for SYS.SYSREQUIREDPERM. Before 10.2 release, we should drop SYS.SYSREQUIREDPERM from the Derby code and update the Grant/Revoke functional spec accordingly.
