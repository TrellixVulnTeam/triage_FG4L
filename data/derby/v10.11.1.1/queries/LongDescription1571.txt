NetworkServerControlImpl.consoleExceptionPrintTrace() prints the stack
trace to System.err if logWriter is null. This has occasionally caused
errors in the regression tests. See
http://www.multinet.no/~solberg/public/Apache/10.2.0.3_Snapshot/jvm1.5/testlog/sparc_zone3/412239-derbyall_diff.txt
for an example.

The test failure happens when NetworkServerControlImpl.shutdown() has
sent the shutdown command and starts a loop calling ping() until it
gets an error. Since it expects ping() to fail, it sets logWriter to
null to avoid getting error messages printed on the console.

In most cases, the network server is already stopped before the first
call to ping(). Then ping() fails when calling setUpSocket(), and no
message is printed. On the other hand, if the server is stopped while
ping() is being executed, the error might occur other places. For
instance, it might fail with a SocketException in
fillReplyBuffer(). fillReplyBuffer() then calls clientSocketError(),
which in turn calls consolePropertyMessage() and
consoleExceptionPrintTrace().  consolePropertyMessage() correctly
suppresses the error message, but consoleExceptionPrintTrace() prints
the stack trace.
