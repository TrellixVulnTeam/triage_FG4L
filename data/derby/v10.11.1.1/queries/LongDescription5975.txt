Across multiple versions nightly tests have failed in Derby5937SlaveShutdownTest.testSlaveFailoverLeak.
Subsequent to this no other test runs and thus we get no info printed to the log, and the ibm test
reporter does not post anything other than a red box if the tests do not finish.  Not sure if the
tests are hanging as part of trying to clean up the failure or if the next test is hanging.  Will post 
test runs that have failed in additional comments.

So far I have only seen this on weme6.2 windows runs.  Likely there is a timing issue that causes the
test to fail and then bad cleanup of this test leads to hang.  In the one stack I see as thread stuck
in shutdown and a thread stuck waiting on the log.  

If no easy fixes for this it may make sense to disable this test in this one environment until someone
wants to work on this one.  Then we can at least get the rest of the testing to procede.
