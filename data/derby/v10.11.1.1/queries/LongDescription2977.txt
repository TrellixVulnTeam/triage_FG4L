The replication master role includes many tasks:


	set up a network connection to the slave
	sending the database to the slave before starting replication
	make sure that log records are appended to the network buffer, and that the log is later sent to the slave
	etc



This issue is for adding a controller that will start/stop/initiate all services needed for the replication master role.
