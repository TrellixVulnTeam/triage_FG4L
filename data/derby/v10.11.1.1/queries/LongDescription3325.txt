The classes in Derby implementing javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource must provide setter and getter methods for the property 'maxStatements'.
This property is used to control the whether the data source should produce pooled connections with statement cache capabilities or not, and how big the statement cache is allowed to be.

This issue only deals with the client JDBC driver.
