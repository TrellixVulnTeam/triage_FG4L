The issue is specific to the DerbyNet client driver, and doesn't seem to occur using embedded Derby.

 "PreparedStatement.setObject(int, Object, Types.CLOB)". It seems to be a problem updating a CLOB column with a parameterized value using the DerbyNet client driver, and if the update SQL ends up updating more than one row. I attached a simple test case that just uses JDBC to reproduce the error. The exception looks like this:

org.apache.derby.client.am.BatchUpdateException: Non-atomic batch failure.  The batch was submitted, but at least one exception occurred on an individual member of the batch. Use getNextException() to retrieve the exceptions for specific batched elements.
