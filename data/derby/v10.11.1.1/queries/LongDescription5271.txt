When certain types of errors are raised while the network server is processing a client request, the server is left in a semi-degraded state. The problem this issue is concerned with, is that the client socket is kept open even though the server in a kind of degraded state (server JVM still alive). This causes the client to hang, until the server JVM is killed, in a read-call on the socket.

I'm able to reproduce this with an OOME being raised on the server.

In my opinion, hanging when there is no chance of progression is bad behavior. Furthermore, it causes trouble for automated testing.
