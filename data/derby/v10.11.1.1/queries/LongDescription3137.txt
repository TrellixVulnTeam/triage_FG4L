As a next step after adding support for the roles syntax, I intend to
make a patch which implements catalog support for roles,
cf. SYS.SYSROLES described in the specification (attached to
DERBY-2207). Also the patch should tie this support up to the parser
support, so the role statements can be executed. Any privileges
granted to roles would still have no effect at run-time.
