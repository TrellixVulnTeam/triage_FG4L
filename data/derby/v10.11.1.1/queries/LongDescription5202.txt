Kim has discovered that some severe build errors can be eliminated by adding colnum and colwidth attributes to the colspec elements in our dita documentation. The MessageBuilder generates the dita source for the documentation of Derby's SQLStates. The dita it generates has colspecs with colwidth attributes but not colnum attributes. We should fix MessageBuilder to generate colwidth attributes too.
