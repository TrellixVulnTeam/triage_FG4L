The client system property -Dderby.client.traceDirectory does not work with ClientXADataSource. No trace files are created if this property is set when making XA Connections.

I am sure it works fine with DriverManager connections and also checked tracing works fine using connection attributes and XA with.  ds.setConnectionAttributes("traceDirectory=./traceDir");

I have not checked  ClientDataSource or ClientConnectionPoolDataSource.

Attached is a reproduction for this issue.
mkdir ./traceDir

javac -g XATemplate.java  utilXid.java
java -Dderby.client.traceDirectory="./traceDir" XATemplate

You will see that traceDir is empty.
This came up when debugging DERBY-5552
