There was discussion on the list regarding how  to handle this issue but keep the BOOLEAN work for inclusion in future releases.  The approach discussed was to back the DERBY-499 work out of the 10.2 branch as soon as it is created, but leave it in the trunk

I think this an acceptable solution but  only if we can get someone assigned to this issue that is willing to commit now to doing that work as soon as we branch.   The reverse merge may be messy at that point do to other changes that have gone in.  

Is there someone who will volunteer to do this work and assign themselves to this issue?
