One of the tests in jdbc40/StatementTest.junit fails with the following message:

"Attempt to shutdown framework: DerbyNetClient

Log:
DERBY-839 (Partial).  Internationalize Connection.java.  Also upgraded
the "i18n lint" test to be a little more intelligent, and to not exit
on the first failure.

Passes derbynetclientmats.  All changes are client-specific so derbyall
was not run."
