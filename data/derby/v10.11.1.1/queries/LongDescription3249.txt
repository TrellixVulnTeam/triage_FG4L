JDBC 4 section 13.6 states:

 The concurrency of the ResultSet object returned by getGeneratedKeys must be CONCUR_READ_ONLY. The type of the ResultSet object must be either TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY or TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE.

Since in some cases Derby generates the generated keys ResultSet using the Statement object it inherits the concurrency and type of that statement.
