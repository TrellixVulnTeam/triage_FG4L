Since J2ME support was added to the simple demo (bin-releases: demo/programs/simple/SimpleApp.java) in DERBY-2216 (first available in 10.3.1.4), the demo has not worked in a pure client setting as described in the documentation (bin-releases: demo/programs/simple/example.html). This is a regression from 10.2.2.0.
