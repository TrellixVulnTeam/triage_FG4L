The test coverage report for SqlXmlUtil indicates that we don't have tests for:


	recompilation of XML queries used in triggers (the code looks dead, and can probably be removed)




	serialization of sequences of atomic values returned by an XPath query (as far as I can see, we only support single atomic values and sequences of documents, so probably that's also code that can be removed, possibly replaced by an assert)




	XMLEXISTS operations where the XPath query returns a scalar (after DERBY-6624, it will take the same code path as a query that returns a non-empty sequence, so it won't show up in the report anymore, but it's still useful to have a test case for it)




	XMLQUERY operations where the XPath query returns a boolean (after DERBY-6624, the same code path will be taken for all data types, so it won't show up in the report anymore, but it's still useful to have a test case for it)
