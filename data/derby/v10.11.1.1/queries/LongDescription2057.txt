There seems to be an error on the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE documentation or the implementation itself when passing the following arguments:

PURGE_ROWS
    If PURGE_ROWS is set to a non-zero value, then a single pass is made through the table which will purge committed deleted rows from the table.
<snip>

DEFRAGMENT_ROWS
    If DEFRAGMENT_ROWS is set to a non-zero value, then a single defragment pass is made which will move existing rows from the end of the table towards the front of the table.
<snip>

TRUNCATE_END
    If TRUNCATE_END is set to a non-zero value, then all contiguous pages at the end of the table will be returned to the operating system.
<snip>

The implementation only checks if the above arguments are 1s.

org.apache.derby.iapi.db.OnlineCompress.compressTable(
            schema, 
            tablename, 
            (purgeRows == 1),
            (defragementRows == 1),
            (truncateEnd == 1));
