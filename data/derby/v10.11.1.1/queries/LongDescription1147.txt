These are described in the overview section 3.1 of the JDBC4 spec:

"Added the methods getRowId, setRowId, getNClob, getNString,
getCharacterStream, getNCharacterStream, setNString,
setNCharacterStream, setNClob, getSQLXML, setSQLXML.
Overloaded the setClob and setBlob methods."

Most of these methods will throw SQLFeatureNotSupporteException because our client drivers do not support the ROWID, National String, and XML datatypes. However, we should implement the getCharacterStream() method and the setClob() and setBlob() overloads.
