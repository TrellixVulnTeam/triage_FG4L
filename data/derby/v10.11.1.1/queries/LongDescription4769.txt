If the option "derby.drda.logConnections" is enabled, the network server logs new connections, but doesn't log disconnects. There seems to be no way to enable logging of disconnects. But having disconnects also logged would be useful to analyse, if applications do properly disconnect from the server or if there is a resource leak.

Maybe consider a second option (e.g. "derby.drda.logDisconnects") if you want to keep the existing option "pure".

It would also be helpful if the log shows how many connections are currently active or even better a list where one could see the active connections per database. This feature might be enabled using an option like "derby.drda.traceConnections"
