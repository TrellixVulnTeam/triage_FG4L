If the current directory is something liket

Java user dir:
c:\export\home\tmp\os136789\testingDerby\CYGWIN_NT-5.2_i686-unknown\derbyall

The test harness for multi tests is creating a log file based off that
path, but is getting confused by the '.', assuming that is the lead in
to a suffix. Thus it comes up with a log file of:

C:\export\home\tmp\os136789\testingDerby\CYGWIN_NT-5.log

which is outside the user.dir (current directory) and so of course,
correctly, permission has not been granted to create that file.

Thus this causes stress.multi to fail when the security manager is enabled.
