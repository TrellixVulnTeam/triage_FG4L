Just noting this whilst looking at the dblook code..  I have no current need for it at the moment..

Currently the loadDriver() function in dblook.java uses one of two hard coded drivers (com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver or org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver) based upon the URL supplied on the command.

In the future, an alternative driver may be used, so dblook should allow the driver to be specified (e.g. the ij tool allows this to be specified via properties).
