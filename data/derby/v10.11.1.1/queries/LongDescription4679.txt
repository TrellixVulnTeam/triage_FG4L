The above query returns no results despite the fact that the database contains results that match the query.  
Slight modifications to the query that shouldn't change the outcome cause it to return the expected results.  For example: changing 
"t3.FAMILY_ITEM_ID  in('_5VetVWTeEd-Q8aOqWJPEIQ')" 
to 
"t3.FAMILY_ITEM_ID  in('_5VetVWTeEd-Q8aOqWJPEIQ', 'blah')" 
or 
"t3.FAMILY_ITEM_ID  = '_5VetVWTeEd-Q8aOqWJPEIQ'"

or removing  
"(t5.ROOT_ITEM_ID = '_5ZDlwWTeEd-Q8aOqWJPEIQ') and "
despite the fact that the results show that t5.ROOT_ITEM_ID is equal to the string above.

Note that there is no error message associated with the incorrect query, it just returns zero rows.

The query below doesn't use join statements and works as expected.
