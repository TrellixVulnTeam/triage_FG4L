IBM lab nightly regression testing is seeing numerious intermittent errors while running the
AutoloadTest.   This regression testing often runs multiple runs of Suites.all on the same machine at
the same time and uses the -Dderby.tests.basePort=3500 option to the tests to insure network
server is created on different ports and don't intefere.

I think the following code in this test that spawn a process is not going pass that port info onto the network
server startup and then lead to problems:

    /**

	Run 
{@code AutoloadTest}
 in a separate JVM.
     */
    public void spawnProcess() throws Exception {
        String[] cmd = 
{
            "junit.textui.TestRunner", spawnedTestClass.getName()
        }
;



        SpawnedProcess proc =
            new SpawnedProcess(execJavaCmd(cmd), spawnedTestClass.getName());

        if (proc.complete() != 0) 
{
            fail(proc.getFailMessage("Test process failed"));
        }
    }
