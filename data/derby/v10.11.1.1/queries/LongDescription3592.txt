The Java 5 javadoc tool seems to have a bug. This bug seems to be fixed in Java 6. The issue is discussed in the following email thread: http://www.nabble.com/some-comments-on-the-10.4-beta-distribution-td16408536.html#a16408536 which puts forward the following theory:

"The exact same javadoc directive is used to build the jdbc3 and jdbc4 public apis. The spurious line turns up in the jdbc3 javadoc but not the jdbc4 javadoc. The jdbc3 javadoc is built with the Java 5 javadoc tool and the jdbc4 javadoc is built with the Java 6 javadoc tool. I think that the Java 5 javadoc tool may have a bug that was corrected in Java 6.

What we're trying to do in this <doctitle> element is a bit tricky. We are trying to generate javadoc whose overview page has a title consisting of the Derby logo followed by some useful text. The <doctitle> element does not allow nested image elements, and we appear to have hacked around this by stuffing the image and text into a CDATA section. That CDATA section survives the Java 6 javadoc tool but is munged by the Java 5 javadoc tool.

I can get rid of the spurious line at the cost of removing the Derby logo. That is, I get rid of the CDATA section and just put text inside the <doctitle> element like so:

<Doctitle> Apache Derby $
{major}
.$
{minor}
 API Documentation</Doctitle> 

I miss the pretty logo, but I think that the output without the logo looks better than the output with both the logo and the spurious line."
