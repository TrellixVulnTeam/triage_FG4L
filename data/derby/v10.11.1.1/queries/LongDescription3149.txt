Create ant targets in build.xml to compile and run the package private tests.

The first step will be to run the tests against the classes directories. Implementing a solution that runs against jars is not technically difficult, it just brings a host of decisions to be taken... Maybe even more important, does running against the jars add any value?

The compile will be included in the 'all' target to test the implementation. Feel free to post your concerns if you think building the package private tests should be a manual action only.
The tests will also be run as part of junit-all / junitreport.
