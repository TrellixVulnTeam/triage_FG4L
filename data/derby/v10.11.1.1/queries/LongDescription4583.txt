A SELECT query with a literal boolean value in its WHERE clause results in a syntax error.

How to reproduce:

CREATE TABLE list (value VARCHAR(10));

Given this table, the following queries result in a syntax error.

SELECT * FROM list WHERE TRUE;
SELECT * FROM list WHERE FALSE;
SELECT * FROM list WHERE value='A' OR TRUE;

Why is TRUE/FALSE not a boolean expression?
