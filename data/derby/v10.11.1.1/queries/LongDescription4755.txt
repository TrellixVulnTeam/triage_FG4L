DERBY-4601 added a new message to derby.log during engine shutdown and it changed the database shutdown message. Need to update docs with that information. I have found 2 places in our docs where we show examples of shutdown messages
1)In Getting started Guide, under Creating a Derby database and running SQL statements section, we show a typical startup and shutdown message. That section will need to change
2)In Derby Developer's Guide, under section Derby System -> Shutting down the system


An eg of engine shutdown message in derby.log is
2010-07-23 18:59:24.078 GMT Thread[main,5,main] :Shutting down Derby Engine

An eg of database shutdown message is as follows
2010-07-20 17:23:55.171 GMT:
Shutting down instance 80220011-0129-f0e1-f479-0000000c5ef0 on database directory C:\p4clients\svnmain\client2\trunk\systest\out142\dbs\tours3 with class loader sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@3f6e3f6e 
(Notice that this message includes the name of the db getting shutdown. Before the changes for DERBY-4601 went in, we didn't include the name of the database)
