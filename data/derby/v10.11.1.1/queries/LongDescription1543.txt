Address two remaining sub-tasks:

Add warning when sqlAuthorization is on with authentication off: This is a precautionary warning, since sqlAuthorization doesn't mean much without authentication being ON.

Drop permission descriptors when objects they cover are dropped: This applies to tables, routines. When these objects are dropped, automatically drop their permisson descriptors.
