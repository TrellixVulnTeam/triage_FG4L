Seen in tests lang/wisconsin.sql and jdbcapi/maxfieldsize.java when running with the network server and the new security policy file that grants permisions on a per-jar basis. Unless permission is given to the network serve code (since it is in the stack) to access temp files in the database the test will fail.

  permission java.io.FilePermission "$
{derby.system.home}
$
{/}wombat${/}
tmp$
{/}
-", "read, write, delete";

Most likely the temp files are being accessed in without a privileged block.

Easy to reproduce once the new policy file changes are checked in (see http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/SecurityManagerTesting) by removing the permission in the derby_tests.policy  file and running these tests using the jar files.
