The result of the select is not sorted in "order by COUNT DESC" or "order by COUNT ASC" 

create table yy (a double, b double);

insert into yy values (2, 4);
insert into yy values (5, 7);
insert into yy values (2, 3);
insert into yy values (2, 3);
insert into yy values (2, 3);
insert into yy values (2, 3);
insert into yy values (9, 7);


select b, COUNT AS "COUNT_OF", SUM(b) AS "sum b" 
from yy
where a = 5 or a = 2
group by b
order by COUNT asc

â€“ same result as:

select b, COUNT AS "COUNT_OF", SUM(b) AS "sum b" 
from yy
where a = 5 or a = 2
group by b
order by COUNT desc
