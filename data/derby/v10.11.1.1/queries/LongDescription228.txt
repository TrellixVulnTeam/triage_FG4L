The MANIFEST.MF for derby.jar file has some support details for OSGI. However, there are some issues with it:

	the Bundle-version number does not change with each build.
  This would not be a problem if we'd never publish an intermediate build,
  but as we do (snapshots), the Bundle-version number should change.
  Having the same bundle-version over different builds can cause trouble 
  updating to the next (snapshot) and may cause confusion over what is 
  exactly in the bundle.
  We could add the buildnumber into the Bundle-version number.
	Import-Package does not need java.sql
  Derby does need java.sql to function, but as it's in the java namespace,
  it will be loaded (if present) into every bundle that needs it even if
  not specified in the import package entry.
