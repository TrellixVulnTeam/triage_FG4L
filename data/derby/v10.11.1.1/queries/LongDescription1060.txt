The JDBC 4 spec says:

  Once a ResultSet has been closed, any attempt to access any of its
  methods with the exception of the isClosed method will result in a
  SQLException being thrown.

This is not always the case in Derby, and the behaviour is not the
same on the client driver and the embedded driver.

The following ResultSet methods do not throw an exception when the
result set is closed:

  Client driver:

    clearWarnings()
    close()
    getMetaData()
    getStatement()
    getWarnings()

  Embedded driver:

    close()
    getConcurrency()
    getRow()
    getStatement()
    getType()
    rowDeleted()
    rowInserted()
    rowUpdated()
    setFetchDirection()
    getFetchDirection()
    setFetchSize()
    getFetchSize()
