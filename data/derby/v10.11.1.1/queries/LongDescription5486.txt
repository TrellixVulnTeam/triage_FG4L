The following code in UpgradeRun needs to be reworked to verify that sequence/identities behave as expected when upgrading from 10.8.2.2:

                if ( lessThan( version, new int[] 
{ 10, 8, 1, 6 }
 ) )
                { suite.addTest(Changes10_8_2.suite(phase)); }

The following might do the trick:

                if (oldMinor < 7)
                    suite.addTest(Changes10_7.suite(phase));
                if (oldMinor < 9)
                {
                    suite.addTest(Changes10_9.suite(phase));
                    suite.addTest(Changes10_8_2.suite(phase));
                }

Thanks to Kristian for spotting this.
