We occasionally see hangs in the replication tests on Linux. For example here: http://dbtg.foundry.sun.com/derby/test/Daily/jvm1.6/testing/testlog/sles/1298470-suitesAll_diff.txt

This test run was stuck in tearDown() after ReplicationRun_Local_Derby4910.testSlaveWaitsForMaster(). (Waiting for Thread.join() to return.)
