BrokeredConnection has a method called getJDBCLevel() whose only purpose is to provide a value that can be stored in BrokeredStatement.jdbcLevel. This field is only used once, in BrokeredStatement.createDuplicateStatement():

		if (jdbcLevel == 2)
			newStatement = conn.createStatement(resultSetType, resultSetConcurrency);
		else
			newStatement = conn.createStatement(resultSetType, resultSetConcurrency,
                    resultSetHoldability);

Since getJDBCLevel() only returns 2 if Java version 1.3 is used, and Derby doesn't support Java 1.3 any more, BrokeredConnection.getJDBCLevel() and BrokeredStatement.jdbcLevel could be removed.
