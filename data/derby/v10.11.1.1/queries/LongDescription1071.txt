Usernames passed to the UserAuthenticator#authenticateUser are passed as is from the connection url.  If the user name passed in has delimited quotes, then derby retains the delimiter quotes and passes it to UserAuthenticator#authenticateUser.

Javadoc for this method should mention this explicitly so users can write their authentication modules correctly.
