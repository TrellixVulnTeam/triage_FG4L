Derby does not recognize the wrapper objects when trying to match Java methods to the signatures of procedures with OUT arguments. For instance, the following procedure declaration

create procedure proc
(
    out intCol int
)
language java
parameter style java
no sql
external name 'zz.proc'

is supposed to match both of the following Java signatures:

public  static  void    proc( int[] arg ) 
{...}
public  static  void    proc( Integer[] arg ) {...}

However, only the first signature is matched. I will attach a test case which shows this.
