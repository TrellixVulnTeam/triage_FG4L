Problem report from Kathey Marsden:

There seems to be some sort of problem with the sanity state.

After ant clobber, rm -rf jars, rm -rf snapshot  no apparent problematic
files, ant -Dsane=false snapshot  seemed to sometimes build the jars to
the sane jar directory and yield the following error.
....
  [delete] Deleting directory D:\svn\opensource\10.1\javadoc\sourcedir
   [mkdir] Created dir: D:\svn\opensource\10.1\snapshot

BUILD FAILED
D:\svn\opensource\10.1\build.xml:1287:
D:\svn\opensource\10.1\jars\insane not found.

A reliable  workaround was to run
ant insane
before ant -Dsane=false snapshot.
