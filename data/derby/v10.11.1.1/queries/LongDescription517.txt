RecordSet - relative(int rows) behaves different in embedded and client/server mode when the positioning before the first row or after the last row.

The embedded driver shows the behaviour described in the JDBC 3.0 specification, returning false and postitioning in either before first or after last. While the client/server driver returns true and incrementing/decrementing the current row by "rows" and not setting the position to either before first of after last.

I have run a test with a result set with 10 rows, where I positioned in row 5 and moved +20 and - 20 using relative(int rows). With the embedded driver the method returned false, the current row was set to 0 and isAfterLast() and isBeforeFirst() returned true (for +20 and -20 respectively). With the client/server driver the method returned true, the current row was set to 25 and -15 (for +20 and -20 respectively) and isAfterLast() and isBeforeFirst() returned false.

I have also run a test as the first one but running next() 5 times instead of absolute(5) for postitioning in row 5, and then relative(20) produced the expected results with the client/server driver.
