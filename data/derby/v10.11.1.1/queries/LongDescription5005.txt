I have a strange issue that can be reproduced easily with the following objects in schema "test":

create table a (a integer);
insert into a (a) values(1);
create view v as select * from a;

This works:
select test.a.a from test.a where test.a.a <> 2 order by test.a.a asc;

This doesn't work:
select test.v.a from test.v where test.v.a <> 2 order by test.v.a asc;

But this does:
select test.v.a from test.v where test.v.a <> 2 order by v.a asc;

This is the error I get:
Error: 'TEST.V' is not an exposed table name in the scope in which it appears.
SQLState:  42X10
ErrorCode: -1

I've tried quite a few SELECT clauses, and I think the ORDER BY clause is the only one having this issue.
