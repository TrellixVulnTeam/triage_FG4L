CREATE TABLE kb.constant_term
(
        term_id                 BIGINT NOT NULL GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY (START WITH 648518346341351400, INCREMENT BY 1),
        constant_name      VARCHAR(1024) NOT NULL
);

The above SQL causes the table to be created but no columns to be defined (no error message is reported). If I change  648518346341351400 to a 0, then the table is created normally with all the columns defined correctly.
