Derby implements the following syntax:

REFERENCING
{
{ OLD | NEW }
 [ AS ] correlation-Name [ 
{ OLD | NEW }
 [ AS ] correlation-Name ] | 
{ OLD_TABLE | NEW_TABLE } [ AS ] Identifier [ { OLD_TABLE | NEW_TABLE }
[AS] Identifier ] 
}

The SQL standard specifies:

<trigger definition> ::=
CREATE TRIGGER <trigger name> <trigger action time> <trigger event>
ON <table name> [ REFERENCING <transition table or variable list> ]
<triggered action>
.......
<transition table or variable> ::=
OLD [ ROW ] [ AS ] <old transition variable name>


 NEW [ ROW ] [ AS ] <new transition variable name>


 OLD TABLE [ AS ] <old transition table name>


 NEW TABLE [ AS ] <new transition table name>
