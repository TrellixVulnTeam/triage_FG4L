An insane Derby raises a verification error when trying to run the following query:

values( negateInt( getNullInt() ) );

where negateInt() takes a primitive int argument and getNullInt() returns an Integer.

Sane Derby raises an assertion. The same test case, run against 10.3.3.1, also fails but raises a more graceful compile-time exception.
