2 i18n tests refer to ij functionality that no longer exists: ij.unicodeEscape. This is referenced in the following places:

	test i18n/LocalizedDisplay_app.properties
       this test is getting converted into junit with DERBY-1726, but the ij.unicodeEscape property is useless and should be removed anyway
	test (name) i18n/UnicodeEscape_JP
       this tests tests adds nothing to existing tests in its current incarnation and can be removed
	org.apache.derby.iapi.tools.i18n.LocalizedResource
       methods:
	getUnicodeEscape and setUnicodeEscape
          used to set and unset the property but are not used except in toString and can be removed
	toString
          prints out the ijUnicodeEscape property value, but as it doesn't do anything, the reference can be removed.
