Add an interface for streams that are aware of their position and that can reposition itself on request.
Initially there will be two such stream objects; PositionedStoreStream and LOBInputStream.

The interface will be used to allow the Clob implementation (including UTF8Reader) to handle the various internal Clob representations in a consistent manner when it comes to positioning the underlying byte stream.
