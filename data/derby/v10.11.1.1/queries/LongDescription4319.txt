The test run for 10.5.2.0 hung in suites.All. The console output (the run was with -Dderby.tests.trace=true) showed ttestDefaultProperties had successfully completed but the run was halted.
ps -eaf | grep java showed the process that kicked off suites.All, and a networkserver process with the following flags:

	classpath <classpath including derby.jar, derbytools.jar, derbyclient.jar, derbynet.jar, derbyTesting.jar, derbyrun.jar, derbyTesting.jar and junit.jar> -Dderby.drda.logConnections= -Dderby.drda.traceAll= -Dderby.drda.traceDirectory= -Dderby.drda.keepAlive= -Dderby.drda.timeSlice= -Dderby.drda.host= -Dderby.drda.portNumber= -derby.drda.minThreads= -Dderby.drda.maxThreads= -Dderby.drda.startNetworkServer= -Dderby.drda.debug= org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start -h localhost -p 1527
This process had been sitting for 2 days.
After killing the NetworkServerControl process, the test continued successfully (except for DERBY-4186, fixed in trunk), but the following was put out to the console:
