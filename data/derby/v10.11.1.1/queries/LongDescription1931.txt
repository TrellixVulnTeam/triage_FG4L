After adding the Apache Derby Nature to an Eclipse project, the four Derby JAR files appear individually in the Package Explorer View.   It would be neater if they were grouped as a single library called "Apache Derby Library", in the same way that the JARs distributed with a Java run-time environment appear as "JRE System Library".
