The implementations of CatalogRowFactory.buildColumnList() can be simplified in a number of ways:
  1) precision & scale are always passed in as zero and can be removed
   2) adding static factory methods to SystemColumnImpl would ease the building of the arrays by not requiring the additional redundant arguments the constructor call forces today, e.g. max length i snot required to create an INTEGER column.
    3) The column's position is not required to be stored in the SytstemColumn class, it's defined by the position in the array

4) arrays can be built using
          new SystemColumn[] 
{ ... }
     syntax instead of the existing
            columnList[0] = ...
            columnList[1] = ...

      or

            columnList[index++] = ...
            columnList[index++] = ...
