Initial investigations indicate there are no existing suitable methods to properly reset a prepared (or callable) statement for reuse with a statement pool.
A full reset is too heavy weight and defeats the purpose of statement pooling, but a proper procedure should be achievable by reusing existing pieces of code.

Correctness is of course the most important thing.
