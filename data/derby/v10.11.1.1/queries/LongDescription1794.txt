A number of tests in the regression suite rely on starting up a network server and subsequently connecting to it.  Each tends to have some sort of "wait" mechanism and may fail if the wait is "too" long.   It is often sort of cryptic to tell why these tests have failed if the real reason is the network server did not start in a reasonable amount of time.  It would be good to develop a test that specifically looked at network server start up time and verified from release to release that it was behaving correctly.
