dblook does have support for grant/revoke although I am unsure of its quality, cf, my questions
in DERBY-3868. Nevertheless, I choose to build support for roles for dblook.
Since role creation and the granting of roles is only allowed for the data base owner in the first basic
roles implementation, expanding the existing dblook tests to just dump the roles and roles grants should be easy.

In general though, the dblook output file, in order to receate a database, must potentially use several connection, so the objects will be owned by the original owner. [The model for running the presently generated script run seems to be within one connection.] Setting roles properly to be able to recreate a view with the correct owner, for example, would be part of such a more advanced script which would be object owner aware.

My intention with this issue is just to add support for dumping roles and role grants.
