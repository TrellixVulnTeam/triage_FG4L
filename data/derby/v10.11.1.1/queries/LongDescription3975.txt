I defined my own locale (en_US_aisb) where the collation rules said that a=b. When I tried queries with SELECT DISTINCT, they didn't always eliminate all duplicates. Here's an example:

ij> connect 'jdbc:derby:db;create=true;territory=en_US_aisb;collation=TERRITORY_BASED';
ij> create table t (x varchar(10));
0 rows inserted/updated/deleted
ij> insert into t values 'a','b','abba','baab','ABBA';
5 rows inserted/updated/deleted
ij> select distinct * from t;
X         
----------
ABBA      
b         
a         
abba      

4 rows selected
ij> select distinct * from t order by x;
X         
----------
a         
abba      
ABBA      

3 rows selected

The first query did eliminate the duplicate "abba"/"baab", but it did not eliminate the duplicate "a"/"b". When an ORDER BY clause was added (the second query), all the duplicates were eliminated.
