Just some small comments about the Javadoc for the org.apache.derby.iapi.store.access.Qualifier interface, that made it hard for me to understand. (see http://db.apache.org/derby/javadoc/engine/)

1. In examples 1a through 4 there looks to be a missing [] in the array initialization.  In example 1a, instead of:
  qualifier = new Qualifier[3]; // 3 AND clauses

I think it should be:
  qualifier = new Qualifier[3][]; // 3 AND clauses

Similar for 2 through 4.

2. The formatting is messed up as the text for the examples appears as one long hyperlink in the seeAlso section.

3. This pseudo-code doesn't look right.  I don't think there should be a test on qualifier.negateCompareResult() at the outer level?

if (qualifier.negateCompareResult())
  {


      compare_result =
      row[(qualifier.getColumnId())].compare(


        qualifier.getOperator(),
        qualifier.getOrderable(),
        qualifier.getOrderedNulls(),
        qualifier.getUnknownRV())


    if (qualifier.negateCompareResult()) {

          compare_result = !(compare_result);


}
