Per this email thread:

The Derby UI plugin throws an exception when trying to start the Derby network server with Eclipse 3.1M6 or higher.

The fix for this is simple, and involves only changing a class name in 4 files per the email above.  Eclipse 3.1 is now GA so this fix should be made to the UI plug-in which will allow it to work with the current release of Eclipse.  

Also, by adding this fix the plug-ins will no longer work with 3.0.x through 3.1M5 builds of Eclipse.
