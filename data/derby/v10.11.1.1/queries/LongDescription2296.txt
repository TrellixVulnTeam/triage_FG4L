Not sure exactly where this was deprecated but on Client DataSources it appears that the getProperties method was made private.  In Geronimo we were using this to inquire and set whether a create=true was set for a database.  


We are moving from 10.1.3.1 to 10.2.1.6 (or perhaps 10.2.2.0) for our next version which we are targetting for April of this year.

Is it possible to add the following methods on the ClientDataSource:

 setCreateDatabase (String)
 getCreateDatabase()
 setShutdownDatabase (String)
 getShutdownDatabase()

as they are on the EmbeddedDataSource?
