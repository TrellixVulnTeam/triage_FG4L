DERBY-1245-collateraldamage-v1.patch fixes a little bug in o.a.d.client.am.ClobWriter.java's write(int c) method.
In it's original implementation the int parameter was passed directly to the StringBuffer.append() method, resulting 
in the int being converted to it's string representation and then appended. (i.e. passing the char 'a' to write(int c) 
would append the string "97" to the StringBuffer and thus the Clob. 97 is the ASCII code for the character 'a'.) 

Please note that the patch is attached to DERBY-1245, as that was the Jira issue I was working on when I discovered
 this. This issue is a placeholder of sorts. =)
