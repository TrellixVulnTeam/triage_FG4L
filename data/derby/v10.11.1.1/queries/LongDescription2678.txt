The collation methods in Derby should follow the rules defined by SQL spec in Section 9.13 Collation determination Syntax Rules 2 and 3e. 

According to those rules, 
1)at least one operand shall have a declared type collation (that means if the comparison is sysChar1|userChar1 > sysChar2|userChar2, then such a comparison will fail because both sides of > operator have collation derivation of NONE. But if the comparison is sysChar|userChar1 > sysChar2, then it shouldn't fail because although the left hand operand has collation derivation of NONE, the right hand operand has collation derivation of IMPLICIT and hence the comparison is possible). 
2)every operand whose collation derivation is IMPLICIT shall have the same declared type collation (that means if the comparison is sysChar1 > userChar1WithTerritoryBasedCollation, then such a comparison will fail because left operand has collation derivation as IMPLICIT and collation type as UCS_BASIC and the right operand has collation derivation IMPLICIT and collation type as TERRITORY_BASED. But if the comparison is sysChar1 > sysChar2, then comparison won't fail because both the operands have same collation derivation and type.)
