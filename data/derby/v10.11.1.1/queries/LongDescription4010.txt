org.apache.derby.iapi.error.PassThroughException has its own mechanism to achieve the same functionality as one gets from the initCause() and getCause() methods in java.lang.Throwable. This was needed when Derby supported Java 1.3, which didn't have initCause()/getCause(), but now that we don't support Java 1.3 we could simplify the class.
