BTreeController.reclaim_deleted_rows() contains this piece of code:

        catch (java.lang.ClassCastException cce)
        {
            // because we give up the latch on the leaf before entering this
            // routine, the page might change from a leaf to branch.  If that
            // happens this routine will get a ClassCastException, and we
            // just give up trying to reclaim space.
        }
        finally
        {
            if (controlRow != null)
                controlRow.release();

            return(purged_at_least_one_row);
        }

It intentionally hides ClassCastExceptions, but it also unintentionally hides all other exceptions because of the return statement in the finally clause.
