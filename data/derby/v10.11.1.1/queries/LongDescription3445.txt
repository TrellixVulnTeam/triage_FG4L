It is a bit tricky to use EMMA to measure code coverage for the derby testing.

Modifications must be made to the source both to avoid problems with the SecurityManager and individual tests. It would be good if these modifcations could be done once and for all so that it was easier for anyone to run the tests with EMMA.

It would also be good to have ant tasks that would make it even easier to run the tests with EMMA.
