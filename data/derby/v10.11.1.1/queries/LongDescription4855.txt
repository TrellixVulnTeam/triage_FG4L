Right now, producing a Derby release involves 3 major chunks of work:

1) Producing the release notes (happens the week before the first release candidate is produced)

2) Producing release candidates (and submitting them to community vote)

3) Publishing the release distributions (after the community approves a candidate)

This JIRA organizes work needed to automate the tasks which are part of step (3). Those steps are described here: http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/ReleasePublication
