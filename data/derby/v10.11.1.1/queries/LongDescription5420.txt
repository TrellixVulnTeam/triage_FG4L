TableLockBasicTest failed due to unexpected locale in the runtime statistics.

The execution plans are asserted in this test and I saw this diff:

Expected:
        :
	optimizer estimated row count:            6.00
	optimizer estimated cost:          100.40<
Found:
        :
        optimizer estimated row count:            6,00
	optimizer estimated cost:          100,40<

the latter using a decimal comma whereas a decimal point is expected.
