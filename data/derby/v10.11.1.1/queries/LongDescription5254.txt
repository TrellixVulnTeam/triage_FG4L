The following keywords appear in the non-reserved keywords list in sqlgrammar.jj but are not included in nonReservedKeyword() production further down in that file. The intention was for the following words to be non-reserved keywords. But they are treated as reserved keywords. These keywords should be added to the nonReservedKeyword() production:

MAXVALUE
MINVALUE
CYCLE

Technically, these are supposed to be reserved keywords according to the Standard. However, we wanted to minimize disruption for users by making these non-reserved keywords--and it seems we failed to. Our good intentions are recorded in the functional spec attached to DERBY-712.
