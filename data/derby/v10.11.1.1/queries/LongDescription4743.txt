Attempting to access a global temporary table after commit of an XA transaction in network server fails.   Does anyone know if this is 
actually meant to work.  After a commit of an XA transaction in network server do the connection keep the same transaction context for
subsequent work?  I will commit a change to the XATest.java junit test that shows this.  Is it valid to attempt to use the connection after an
XA end() and XA commit()?
