After fixing the original memory leak, I still run into problems on repeated execution of a sql statement. Take the sample program in the bug and run it with a small heap size (4m). After around 80-90K executions an outofmemory error is thrown. I took snapshots of the heap while the program was running but couldn't find anything obviously wrong.
