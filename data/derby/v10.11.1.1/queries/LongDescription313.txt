In section 4.12 in ../testing/README.htm, the property 

    TestSpecialFlags 

is described for specifying additional properties to RunTest. I could not
find any evidence of this in RunTest or elsewhere. However, the property

    testSpecialProps

is supported by RunTest.java. I found this to work. This property
also has a syntax for specifying more than one property using a "^"
delimiter between properties, i.e.

    testSpecialProps=<prop-1>=<value-1>^ ... ^<prop-n>=<value-n>

Also,I noticed the property "useprocess" (default=true) for controlling
whether RunTest runs the test in a separate vm or a thread in current
vm isn't documented in README.htm.  I suggest it be included, since
it's potentially useful for debugging tests. I could include it in the
patch for derby-313 (I don't think anybody committed it yet) or file a
new JIRA issue.

Looking at RunTest reveals that unit tests are not (yet) runnable with
"useprocess=false", though.
