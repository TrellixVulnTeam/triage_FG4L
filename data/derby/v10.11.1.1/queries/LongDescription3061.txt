Tim Dudgeon, on the user list, reports that the following query returns no results in 10.3.1.4 but works correctly in 10.2. I have verified that the query returns no results in the mainline as well. If you eliminate either of the the conjuncts, then the query returns the correct results:

SELECT MYTABLE.MY_ID
 FROM MYTABLE
 WHERE MYTABLE.MY_ID < 100 AND MYTABLE.MY_ID IN (
2,15,19,20,21,48,49
)

Here is a more complete script which demonstrates the problem:

drop table mytable;

create table mytable ( id int primary key );

insert into mytable ( id )
values
( 0 ), ( 1 ), ( 2 ), ( 3 ), ( 4 ), ( 5 ), ( 6 ), ( 7 ), ( 8 ), ( 9 );

insert into mytable select id + 10 from mytable;
insert into mytable select id + 20 from mytable;
insert into mytable select id + 40 from mytable;
insert into mytable select id + 100 from mytable;

select mytable.id
from mytable
where mytable.id < 100;


select mytable.id
from mytable
where mytable.id in ( 2, 15, 19, 20, 21, 48, 49 );

select mytable.id
from mytable
where mytable.id < 100
and mytable.id in ( 2, 15, 19, 20, 21, 48, 49 );
