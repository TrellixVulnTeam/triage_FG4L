The BooleanDataValue interface and the SQLBoolean class implement the boolean IS operator in their is() and isNot() methods. There is also an (unused) IsNode class for the AST. However, the operator is not exposed in the grammar, so there's no way to use it.

The boolean IS operator is defined in the SQL:2003 standard, part 2, section 6.34 <boolean value expression>.

<boolean test> ::= <boolean primary> [ IS [ NOT ] <truth value> ]

There's also Table 13 â€” Truth table for the IS boolean operator.
