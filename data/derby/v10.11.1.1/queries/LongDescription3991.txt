Truncating a Clob to zero length is allowed according to the JDBC specification, which says the following about the len argument (in the @throws tag):
"SQLException - if there is an error accessing the CLOB value or if len is less than 0 "

Derby throws an exception if zero is passed to truncate.

A quick inspection of the code suggests that truncating a Clob to the empty string is easy to support.
