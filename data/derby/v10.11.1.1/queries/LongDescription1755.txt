If server does not accept the client sent security mechanism, then as part of response for ACCSEC , the server sends the list of supported secmec back to the client. 

If the client can support the secmec sent by the server, then the client can retry the connection request with a secmec that the server said it supports.

Some existing clients like the C client already handle this behavior. It would be nice to have the network client be able to make such choices.
