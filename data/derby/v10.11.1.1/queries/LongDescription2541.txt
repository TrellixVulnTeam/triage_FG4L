Collation support testing needs to be able to create multiple new databases with the collation attribute set., upgrade databases etc.  Add a few basic tests showing how this will work even though the feature is not yet functional.  I looked at the additionalDatabaseDecorator, but it does not seem to have a way to change the attributes.   Another option is to use  JDBCDataSource.setBeanProperty to set the attributes, but then the cleanup is not automatic. I am just starting to look at this so if anyone has any good ideas, please post.
