I think it would be great to see some work in the area of tools for helping
with the analysis of complex query execution. Quite frequently, users of
Derby have trouble comprehending (a) how their query is being translated
into a query plan by the optimizer, and (b) what the execution-time resource
usage of the various parts of the query is.

There are low-level features in Derby which capture this information and
record it, such as logQueryPlan, and the XPLAIN tables, but there is a lot
of opportunity for designing higher-level tools which can process the query
plan and execution statistics information and present it in a more
comprehensible fashion.
