            <title>[DERBY-1364] Client driver does not roll back the effects of a stored procedure when incorrectly invoked by executeQuery()/executeUpdate()</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1364</link>
                <project id="10594" key="DERBY">Derby</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;When executing a stored procedure with executeQuery() and the proc&lt;br/&gt;
doesn&apos;t return exactly one result set, the query should fail and the&lt;br/&gt;
statement should be rolled back. Embedded does this correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client driver, however, does not roll back the statement, so the&lt;br/&gt;
effects of statements executed on nested connections in the stored&lt;br/&gt;
procedure are still visible. The reason for this is that the network&lt;br/&gt;
server executes the statement with execute() instead of&lt;br/&gt;
executeQuery(), so that it succeeds on the server. The client then&lt;br/&gt;
counts the number of result sets, and raises an exception if it is not&lt;br/&gt;
one, but it does not roll back the effects of the stored procedure.&lt;br/&gt;
verified that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same problem exists for executeUpdate(). JCC also has these&lt;br/&gt;
problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="12414209" author="knutanders" created="Thu, 1 Jun 2006 18:10:44 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;The simple solution would be to trap the exception on the client and&lt;br/&gt;
roll back. The problem with this is that it would roll back the entire&lt;br/&gt;
transaction, not only the failing statement as the embedded driver&lt;br/&gt;
does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see these three ways to fix it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  1) Accept that the entire transaction is rolled back. Since the&lt;br/&gt;
     exception indicates that something is wrong with the application&lt;br/&gt;
     (should not use executeQuery()/executeUpdate()) or with the&lt;br/&gt;
     stored procedure (should return the correct number of result&lt;br/&gt;
     sets), I don&apos;t think it does very much harm. The application will&lt;br/&gt;
     probably not try to commit the transaction anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  2) Let the client set a savepoint before executing the query, and&lt;br/&gt;
     roll back to the savepoint if an incorrect number of results is&lt;br/&gt;
     returned. This has the downside of adding complexity to the code&lt;br/&gt;
     and extra round trips between the client and the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  3) Make the network server execute the query with executeQuery() or&lt;br/&gt;
     executeUpdate() instead of execute() in these cases. This way,&lt;br/&gt;
     the error will happen at the server and the embedded driver will&lt;br/&gt;
     ensure that the statement is rolled back correctly. DRDA has no&lt;br/&gt;
     direct support for this, but I think we could use a SET statement&lt;br/&gt;
     (something like what was done in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-506&quot; title=&quot;Implement Statement.setQueryTimeout in the Client Driver&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;DERBY-506&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;DERBY-506&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have opinions on these alternatives? Or other suggestions?&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12414572" author="knutanders" created="Sat, 3 Jun 2006 20:33:50 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;My previous analysis of the problem wasn&apos;t entirely correct. Here&apos;s a&lt;br/&gt;
new attempt (hopefully correct this time):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commit/rollback behaviour when using executeQuery() to call a stored&lt;br/&gt;
procedure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto-commit enabled, no ResultSet returned from the stored procedure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Embedded: The statements executed from the stored procedure are&lt;br/&gt;
    always rolled back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Client: The statements executed from the stored procedure are&lt;br/&gt;
    always committed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Auto-commit enabled, more than one Result Set returned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Embedded: The statements executed from the stored procedure are&lt;br/&gt;
    always rolled back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Client: If Connection.rollback() is called before the statement or&lt;br/&gt;
    connection is closed, the statements executed from the stored&lt;br/&gt;
    procedure are rolled back. If the statement or connection is&lt;br/&gt;
    closed, or Connection.commit() is called, the statements executed&lt;br/&gt;
    from the stored procedure are committed. If the connection dies&lt;br/&gt;
    before any of commit(), rollback() or close() have been called,&lt;br/&gt;
    the statements in the stored procedure are rolled back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Auto-commit disabled, no ResultSet or more than one ResultSet returned&lt;br/&gt;
from the stored procedure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Embedded and client: If commit() is called, the entire transaction&lt;br/&gt;
    is committed, including statements executed from the stored&lt;br/&gt;
    procedure in the failing call to executeQuery(). If rollback() is&lt;br/&gt;
    called, the entire transaction is rolled back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When using executeUpdate() to call a stored procedure which returns&lt;br/&gt;
one or more ResultSets, the embedded driver does not raise an&lt;br/&gt;
exception. The client driver does that, and it has the same&lt;br/&gt;
commit/rollback behaviour as executeQuery() when the stored procedure&lt;br/&gt;
returns more than one ResultSet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the behaviour is the same for embedded and client when&lt;br/&gt;
auto-commit is disabled, none of the complex solutions described in my&lt;br/&gt;
previous comment are needed. We only need to make sure the transaction&lt;br/&gt;
is rolled back when auto-commit is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12417598" author="knutanders" created="Sat, 24 Jun 2006 18:01:00 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Attached a patch (derby-1364-v1.diff) which attempts to fix this&lt;br/&gt;
issue. Description of the patch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Checking of the number of result sets returned was moved from&lt;br/&gt;
   executeUpdate/executeQuery to a point in flowExecute where the&lt;br/&gt;
   transaction has not been auto-committed (otherwise, the transaction&lt;br/&gt;
   would already be committed when the exception was raised).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. If the number of result sets does not match the execute type and&lt;br/&gt;
   auto-commit is enabled, the transaction is rolled back (otherwise,&lt;br/&gt;
   the transaction would be committed when the Statement was closed or&lt;br/&gt;
   re-executed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. All execute* methods in CallableStatement were removed since they&lt;br/&gt;
   have become identical to the methods in PreparedStatement. (Or&lt;br/&gt;
   almost identical. The methods in CallableStatement did not call&lt;br/&gt;
   checkStatementValidity() on errors, but that&apos;s probably a bug.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. SQL state for error message in executeQuery() was changed to match&lt;br/&gt;
   embedded (XJ201/XJ205 -&amp;gt; X0Y78). Updated English and Portuguese&lt;br/&gt;
   messages to use the new SQL state (no other translations existed&lt;br/&gt;
   for XJ201 and XJ205).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Added more rollback tests to jdbcapi/ProcedureTest.junit and&lt;br/&gt;
   enabled all test cases for DerbyNetClient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have run derbyall with no failures except runtimeinfo.java which&lt;br/&gt;
fails all the time. The patch is ready for review. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
