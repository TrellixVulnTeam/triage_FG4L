            <title>[DERBY-132] in place table/index compress which returns space to OS</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-132</link>
                <project id="10594" key="DERBY">Derby</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Each derby table or index is stored in a separate file.  Space from&lt;br/&gt;
deleted rows is eventually reclaimed within the file as is used for&lt;br/&gt;
subsequent inserts into the same file.  That space is not returned to&lt;br/&gt;
the OS unless the user calls the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE&lt;br/&gt;
system procedure.  That procedure will return the unused space in&lt;br/&gt;
the tables and indexes to the OS.  It gets an exclusive lock on the&lt;br/&gt;
table, copies all rows in the indexes and the base table into new&lt;br/&gt;
compressed files and delete the old files.  Prior to jdk 1.4 this was&lt;br/&gt;
the only way to return space from a file to the OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In jdk 1.4 RandomAccessFile was enhanced to allow the truncation of a&lt;br/&gt;
file, which would return the space at the &quot;end&quot; of the file back to&lt;br/&gt;
the OS.  In order to take advantage of this new feature a new&lt;br/&gt;
compress feature is needed in derby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumption is that this work will be used in future work which will&lt;br/&gt;
automatically schedule this job and others in background, with no&lt;br/&gt;
interaction needed from the dba.  The 1st phase of this work will&lt;br/&gt;
simply build a procedure that will do the work.  The 2nd phase will&lt;br/&gt;
be to look into scheduling the procedure automatically as part of&lt;br/&gt;
the current background post commit processing.  Longer term it would&lt;br/&gt;
be best if this fit into a new background task monitor, which could&lt;br/&gt;
schedule larger background tasks balanced against the other priorities&lt;br/&gt;
of the system.  These tasks might include: this new online compress,&lt;br/&gt;
automatic statistics gathering, more proactive deleted row reclamation, ....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed feature will reorganize base tables and indexes, moving&lt;br/&gt;
empty pages to the &quot;end&quot;.  It will release space back to the operating&lt;br/&gt;
system when it has created a chunk of empty pages at the end of the&lt;br/&gt;
file.  It will be designed to run in background, and will lock resources&lt;br/&gt;
of the table for as short a time as possible so that it can iteratively&lt;br/&gt;
process the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reclaim space in the heap, it will scan the heap in page reverse order.&lt;br/&gt;
It will get a short term table lock, process all the rows on a page, and&lt;br/&gt;
then commit that transaction releasing the lock.  The commit will be&lt;br/&gt;
optimized like other internal transactions, and will not need to wait&lt;br/&gt;
for a synchonized write.  Each row moved, will require all the index&lt;br/&gt;
entries for that row to also be updated.  While doing the processing it&lt;br/&gt;
will also take care of processing committed deleted rows.  When space&lt;br/&gt;
is free at the end of the table it will be freed back to the operating&lt;br/&gt;
system, using the RandomAccessFile.setLength() interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reclaim space in the btree, data on pages will be moved rather than&lt;br/&gt;
rows.  Data from pages at the end of the file will be moved to free&lt;br/&gt;
smaller numbered pages.  Again short term table locks will be required,&lt;br/&gt;
and the operation will look similar to the current btree merge operations&lt;br/&gt;
already implemented.  Again when a chunk of pages is free at the end of&lt;br/&gt;
the file, they will be returned to the OS using the same mechanism as&lt;br/&gt;
the heap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
