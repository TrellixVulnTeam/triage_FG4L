            <title>[DERBY-569] Derby network server is printing connection activity on System.out instead of logging it to derby.log</title>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;All the messages are going to the derby.log file except the connection activity. For me,tThis information is not&lt;br/&gt;
important enough to be logged to console.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="12329819" author="oysteing" created="Mon, 19 Sep 2005 19:51:52 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;The current situation is as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you use the existing scripts to start a network sever, it is not possible to turn off console output.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you create your own Java program to start server, you can specify an alternative output or null.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is possible to turn off logging of connections to derby.log by setting derby.drda.logConnections to false.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One solution to this request is to let derby.drda.logConnections also turn off logging of connections to console. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drawback of this is that it will not satisfy those users who would like to turn off logging to the console but keep the tracing in derby.log.   &lt;/p&gt;

I have tested the change by hand, and also run derbyall successfully. Two test output files needed to be changed to reflect that the trace message is no longer printed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please review this change and commit if appropriate. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12356968" author="kmarsden" created="Tue, 8 Nov 2005 03:13:26 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll look at committing this patch.  A few quick questions/comments first&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Have you submitted an ICLA yet?&lt;br/&gt;
2) Did you run with JCC after all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10.2 documentation should be updated with the new behaviour.  Can you update the doc or log a Jira noting the doc locations that need changing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it would be worthwhile mentioning this change in the 10.2  release notes as well.  Maybe a separate Jira issue for that would be good so it doesn&apos;t get lost for the 10.2 release notes.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12356989" author="bryanpendleton" created="Tue, 8 Nov 2005 08:10:49 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hi Kathey,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I did run with the db2jcc driver, once I resolved my problem with having a bad copy of the driver in JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext. &lt;br/&gt;
So I was able to verify the diffs to the NSinSameJVM test in both the DerbyNet and DerbyNetClient suites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will mail my ICLA today; it&apos;s been sitting on my desk for a week now &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be glad to update the doc as well as to udpate the release notes; are these objects under svn control in the same way as the source code? I poked around a bit inside of my &apos;trunk&apos; directory, looking for the source to the docs, but didn&apos;t see anything obvious.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12356991" author="jta" created="Tue, 8 Nov 2005 08:54:34 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Doc source for the Derby manuals is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/docs/trunk/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/docs/trunk/&lt;/a&gt; . Files are in DITA xml format. More info is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://db.apache.org/derby/manuals/dita.html&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://db.apache.org/derby/manuals/dita.html&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12356995" author="kmarsden" created="Tue, 8 Nov 2005 09:14:31 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;OK I will check in as soon as ...&lt;br/&gt;
1)  I hear from you that the ICLA is in the mail&lt;br/&gt;
2) We have one more binding +1 for the change.&lt;br/&gt;
3)  The vote has been up for 24 hours to allow anyone to object.  11/8/2005 1:30pm PST . (Normally I would let it sit for a week but this doesn&apos;t seem very controversial.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Thank you for  following through so completely on this change and making the doc changes.    For the release notes I guess the correct  thing to do for now is put this in the CHANGES file. I noticed  that the CHANGES  file in the trunk has not been restarted  for 10.2. It would be ok to  just start over with &quot;Changes in Derby 10.2&quot; and put your  change in that text file.    The release page happen at the time of the release and this note in the CHANGES file will get picked up then I think.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12357005" author="bryanpendleton" created="Tue, 8 Nov 2005 13:28:30 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Attached is an updated code diff against the current trunk. It is the same as the previous code diff but it includes a change to trunk/CHANGES as suggested by Kathey to restart the CHANGES file for Derby 10.2 and to include a note about this change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also attached is a docs diff; I took a stab at adding a note about the new behavior of derby.drda.logConnections to the two relevant places.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="12377235" author="bryanpendleton" created="Mon, 1 May 2006 23:46:24 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Reopened this issue in order to merge the fix to the 10.1 branch.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12377245" author="kmarsden" created="Tue, 2 May 2006 00:51:40 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;I am borderline about whether this one is appropriate for the 10.1 branch since it changes the behaviour of  derby.drda.logConnections.  It might be a surprising change in a maintenance release.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12377264" author="bryanpendleton" created="Tue, 2 May 2006 03:34:44 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Kathey, I agree: this change is not important enough to be worth putting into the 10.1 branch at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fix is sufficiently useful in my environment that I am running with the patch, but of course I can continue to run with a patched version even after we upgrade to 10.1.3 in my environment.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
