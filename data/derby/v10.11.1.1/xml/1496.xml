            <title>[DERBY-1496] testSecMec needs many masters - should convert to junit</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1496</link>
                <project id="10594" key="DERBY">Derby</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;derbynet/testSecMec.java fails with jcc2.8 with 131 vms.   I have checked the diff and it is a master update with difference in the exception, message string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;diff snippet:&lt;br/&gt;
8 del&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt; T5: jdbc:derby:net://xxxFILTERED_HOSTNAMExxx:xxxFILTEREDPORTxxx/wombat:user=neelima;password=lee;securityMechanism=9; - EXCEPTION java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException is caught when initializing EncryptionManager &apos;Prime size must be multiple of 64, and can only range from 512 to 1024 (inclusive)&apos;&lt;br/&gt;
8a8&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;gt; T5: jdbc:derby:net://xxxFILTERED_HOSTNAMExxx:xxxFILTEREDPORTxxx/wombat:user=neelima;password=lee;securityMechanism=9; - EXCEPTION java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException is caught when initializing EncryptionManager &apos;DH KeyPairGenerator not available&apos;&lt;br/&gt;
14 del&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;----------------&lt;br/&gt;
There is difference in the exception message and will require lot of jvm specific master files which can become difficult to maintain.  Myrna suggested that  this might be a good test to convert to junit. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="12422862" author="myrna" created="Sun, 23 Jul 2006 03:58:35 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;This is my first real foray into the realm of junit tests...&lt;br/&gt;
And I got mixed results, so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would really appreciate it if someone interested in converting tests to junit, or someone who knows how junit tests are supposed to look could review what I&apos;ve done so far and give me feedback...&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The attached patch - &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1496&quot; title=&quot;testSecMec needs many masters - should convert to junit&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;DERBY-1496&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;DERBY-1496&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;_tmp_072206.* - doesn&apos;t modify testSecMec.java at all...&lt;br/&gt;
Because testSecMec.java extends dataSourcePermissions_net.java which extends dataSourcePermissions.java and I&apos;m currently stuck on converting the dataSourcePermissions_net test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I did:&lt;br/&gt;
I started converting jdbcapi/dataSourcePermissions.java which seemed to go well enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first step was to just run the test as a junit test, which meant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;remove main method&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;add setUp method&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;add constructor for taking test name&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;extend from BaseJDBCTestCase&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;replace cleanUp with tearDown&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;add test methods that start with &apos;test&apos; for the actual string&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;replace chatty System.out.printlns with println&lt;br/&gt;
Then I ran this test with &lt;br/&gt;
   java -Dverbose=true -Dkeepfiles=true -Djvmflags=-Dderby.test.debug=true org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunTest jdbcapi/dataSourcePermissions.junit&lt;br/&gt;
The resulting .out was hard to deal with using my vdiff32 on windows, so I&lt;br/&gt;
went ahead and added DEBUG and .DEBUG to Sed.java to be filtered during my conversion&lt;br/&gt;
exercises.&lt;br/&gt;
Now the resulting diff was easy to oversee.&lt;br/&gt;
The next step was to convert all the checkConnections to assertTrue.&lt;br/&gt;
Reran the test, then reran withouth the derby.test.debug and got rid of the .out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As an afterthought, I created a testSuite method.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;So far so good, much encouraged, I went on to work on dataSourcePermissions_net.java.&lt;br/&gt;
And that&apos;s as far as I got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem 1:&lt;br/&gt;
One of the aspects is that I had to add grant a number of permissions that are granted to various jars already, but apparently had to be added again - maybe to junit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem 2:&lt;br/&gt;
There seemed to be no efficient way to get a simple connection to networkserver using a different port than the default 1527. I was quite surprised really that the original test was able to do this with ij.startJBMS().&lt;br/&gt;
I contacted Kathey on the IRC and she said the 20000 was put in at a time that there was no startServer=false property, so it could go back to 1527 now. &lt;br/&gt;
So that&apos;s what the test is doing currently, but I would like to make a way to get connections to a different port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem 3:&lt;br/&gt;
The current test executes setUp and tearDown a number of times. Each time it also calls the super methods. I think I did this wrong, but I am not clear on how to do it instead.&lt;br/&gt;
Probably some of the setup needs to go into a decorator. I&apos;ll experiment with that next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem 4:&lt;br/&gt;
For some reason, I currently only get output for the testDriverManagerPermissions subtest.&lt;br/&gt;
It&apos;s very strange, in the (eclipse) debugger I can see that junit apparently does recognize that it needs to do something with these tests, but all it ends up doing are setUps and tearDowns and shutdowns and starts. No doubt because of me call supers, but I still don&apos;t see why it&apos;s not running the tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&apos;ll keep muddling on, but I thought I&apos;d log what I&apos;ve done so far. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this patch is not suitable for commit.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="12423966" author="djd" created="Fri, 28 Jul 2006 01:22:48 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Just looking at datasourcepermissions I would say you are generally on the right track, but when I run the test using JUnit directly it fails for me.  I think starting by running it in JUnit alone is the best approach, forget the test harness and focus on JUnit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your suite method (correctly) creates four test cases, or as JUnit says &quot;fixtures&quot;. Each fixture will run the setUp and tearDown methods of the class, thus you will run them four times. I don&apos;t know if  that&apos;s what you meant or not. If you want it to be once per-suite then you create a decorator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the normal mode for Junit tests to be that Derby is already running with a database created and the tests are just run against that database. We need to have some decorators that ensure the database is clean, but you can work without them for now (just remove the database each time you run, that&apos;s what the test harness will do when you finally plug into that). I say this because you code is shutting down Derby and re-booting it, I&apos;m not sure why, it may be inherited from the old test and it may be required, but it would be good to keep the normal mode in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also look at the BaseJDBCTest class and the TestConfiguraiton class, if we can factor out DriverManager calls then we also run these tests on J2ME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to stage this would be to create a new JUnit test class based upon datasourcepermissions .java rather than having to convert both tests at the same time, then once your new class is working move onto the _net approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing that jumps oput at me is the setting of the database properties, that&apos;s code that could be common. I just created a SystemPropertyTestSetup class that sets system properties based upon a passed in set, setting database properties could be handled the same way, rather than have each test do it itself.&lt;/p&gt;

WIth the test harness that was ok because it was granted the permission and was at the top of the calling stack.&lt;br/&gt;
With JUnit, the JUnit code is at the top of the stack and so either it needs to be granted the permissions, or ther cleaner&lt;br/&gt;
approach is to have the calls in a privilege block, e.g. see BaseTestCase.setSystemProperty.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I did think about making a test for dataSourcePermissions first, but as the point of this exercise is really to convert testSecMec and dataSourcePermissions is ok as is in java world, I decided I&apos;d tackle all 3 chained tests together...I may still change my mind but will give this another go.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12474192" author="myrna" created="Mon, 19 Feb 2007 15:04:19 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;adjusting the summary. Running with ibm131 is not interesting for trunk.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12478684" author="myrna" created="Wed, 7 Mar 2007 04:36:19 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;After an apparent inactivity of many moons, I&apos;m attaching a preliminary step for a second attempt at converting testSecMed.java.&lt;br/&gt;
While I&apos;m battling testSecMec itself, the attached patch is an attempt at combining relevant parts of users.sql, users2.sql, secureUsers.sql and secureUsers1.sql with dataSourcePermissions/_net.java, so that these 6 tests can be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to creating a number of test classes extending from the basic datasource testing class AuthenticationTest.java, the patch also contains changes to checkDataSource.java. These changes are there because of datasource functionality (almost) tested in dataSourcePermissions_net.java, but which have no authentication aspect. If decided they&apos;d fit better in checkDataSource.&lt;br/&gt;
The new testing in checkDataSource could be done more efficiently, but I&apos;m not getting into that now - maybe that can be addressed when someone converts it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the patch modifies DropDatabaseSetup.java to not use the JDBCDataSource.shutdownDatabase(ds), which results in an attempt to use a ds.setter method not supprted with DerbyNetClient (see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-2296&quot; title=&quot;getProperties method deprecated on ClientDataSource&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;DERBY-2296&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;DERBY-2296&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patch is intended for review only - I have not tested the tests in a suite.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12478686" author="djd" created="Wed, 7 Mar 2007 05:04:21 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Finally the patch modifies DropDatabaseSetup.java to not use the JDBCDataSource.shutdownDatabase(ds), which results in an attempt to use a ds.setter method not supprted with DerbyNetClient (see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-2296&quot; title=&quot;getProperties method deprecated on ClientDataSource&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;DERBY-2296&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;DERBY-2296&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that mean the DropDatabaaseSetup no longer shuts down the database before dropping it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternate solution would be to modify JDBCDataSource.shutdownDatabase(ds) so that it works with the client data source.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12481215" author="djd" created="Thu, 15 Mar 2007 16:42:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;AuthenticationTest has several methods with names that include WOUP:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;assertShutdownWOUPFail&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from the name I can&apos;t figure out what the method is mean to be asserting, what&apos;s a WOUP, how do you shut it down?&lt;br/&gt;
Since the methods also have no java doc comments I can&apos;t figure it out that way either &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/sad.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

WOUP stands for WithOutUser/Password. The difference is in the getConnection - it&apos;s getConnection() (getConnection(url) for DriverMgrAuthentication) vs. getConnection(user, password). It&apos;s only used in a couple of places, but I thought I&apos;d throw it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I floundered looking for a better name. Or would appropriate comments suffice? Or maybe it&apos;s nonsense to have it in the test in the first place...&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12481251" author="djd" created="Thu, 15 Mar 2007 17:45:23 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Minor patch that adds a clear java bean property method to JDBCDataSource and thus allows AuthenticationTest to use JDBCDataSource to manufacture data sources rather than implementing the logic itself.&lt;br/&gt;
The existing logic means that the datasources created would not have the correct configuration such as port number.&lt;br/&gt;
Only one method has been updated in AuthenticationTest, though others could be probably changed as well.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12481270" author="djd" created="Thu, 15 Mar 2007 18:20:26 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;WOUP is fine with comments, makes sense then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;btw AuthenticationTest passes with the patch I posted.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12481303" author="djd" created="Thu, 15 Mar 2007 20:39:31 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m a little confused on AuthenticationTest.assertSystemShutdownFail&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method name would indicate that it&apos;s asserting that an attempt to shutdown the system should fail,&lt;br/&gt;
but the code is perfoming a database shutdown. There&apos;s some comment about not using the database name in&lt;br/&gt;
the comment to the method causes some problems, but I&apos;m not sure having the code perform a different action is the correct solution.&lt;br/&gt;
I&apos;d also assumed that to have a DataSource connect to the system a null databaseName would be used, but this test uses a zero-length&lt;br/&gt;
database name. No idea which is correct or if it&apos;s documented one-way or another.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12481323" author="myrna" created="Thu, 15 Mar 2007 21:17:18 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;That section of the test was intended to test whether a system shutdown with incorrect user/password would get refused, however, I got successful shutdowns (XJ015) instead of checks for user/password. &lt;br/&gt;
It&apos;s likely that in my confusion and wish to move on I messed this up.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12482968" author="myrna" created="Thu, 22 Mar 2007 00:21:29 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;attaching a patch that does the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JDBCDataSource.java:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;uses ds.setConnectionAttributes rather than ds.setShutDownDatabase().&lt;br/&gt;
   The test DriverMgrAuthenticationTest ran into failures on tearDown in clientServer.  I left the old mechanism commented out, with comments...I know normally we&apos;d rely on the svn logs, but I thought in this particular case it might&lt;br/&gt;
be helpful to have the alternative approach in the method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;NSSecurityMechanismTest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;remove the system property setting in tearDown()&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;test now sleeps a bit longer - on my system I was still getting 08001&lt;br/&gt;
  errors. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;resolve a javadoc problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;AuthenticationTest.java&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;suite() methods uses SystemPropertySetup in addition to DatabasePropertySetup.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;suite() and baseSuite() methods are streamlined.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;system level property removed via tearDown method.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;(more) system shutdown testing done in a separate test case&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;system shutdown calls are fixed to actually attempt to shutdown the system (my previous problems with getting this to work properly were because I had only set the requireAuthentication to true at databaselevel.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;added more comments to some of the methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;DriverMgrAuthenticationTest.java, PoolDSAuthenticationTest.java, XADSAuthenticationTest.java:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;adjusted suite, baseSuite, and systemshutdown methods to match AuthenticationTest changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;jdbcapi/_Suite.java:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;added 4 tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;derbynet/_Suite.java: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;added NSSecurityMechanismTest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;suites.All was successful with jdk14. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will commit this.&lt;/p&gt;

            Thread.sleep(120000);&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That sleep in executed a number of times, slowing the test runs down.&lt;br/&gt;
If the server is up and running and giving errors, would that be a bug?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12492825" author="myrna" created="Tue, 1 May 2007 01:10:06 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Dan had suggested on the list, that this test be rewritten to use the testSetup mechanism to start and shutdown the server.&lt;br/&gt;
I have attempted this approach but it&apos;s not as appropriate with this particular test - starting the server (with each security mechanism, invalid, or not) is part of the test. &lt;br/&gt;
Also, once the server is started with a particular mechanism, connections need to specify that mechanim or fail - and so teardown fails.&lt;br/&gt;
Finally, for each security mechanism, the expected values of each check is different. &lt;br/&gt;
In the end, the test got really, really complicated and messy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then attempted to create new databases for each security mechanism, but that also got very messy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end the solution was simple: shutdown the database in all cases (already happened for 2 of the security mechanism settings). before shutting down the server. Then, no wait was needed before attempting connections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after revision 533889, the NSSecurityMechanismTest should run a bit faster.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
