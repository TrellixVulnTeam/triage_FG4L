In the document "db-derby-10.3.2.1-src/java/testing/Readme.txt", there is a bug. In section "2. QuickStart 2.1 running tests", It says:

"
To run a suite:

syntax:
  java -D<testproperty> org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunSuite  <testsuite>
where

    *

         <testproperty> are test specific properties, such as 'verbose' for the RunSuite class.
    *

         <testsuite> is one of the suites under org/apache/derbyTesting/suites

for example for running  the suite derbylang:
   java -Dverbose=true org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunSuite derbylang
"

   However, the sentence "<testsuite> is one of the suites under org/apache/derbyTesting/suites
"  should be replaced with  " <testsuite> is one of the suites under org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/suites".
