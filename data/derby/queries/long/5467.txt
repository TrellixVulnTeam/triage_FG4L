The ending year in the copyright notice used in the API documentation hasn't been updated. Currently the year 2007 or 2008 is being used.
Manually modifying the copyright notice is trivial, but has to be done once a year. It may be possible to automate this (i.e. use current year, or the year of the last change in the code repository?).

Out of curiosity, should the year be updated even if no changes have been made? (somewhat relevant if we decide to automate the update)
