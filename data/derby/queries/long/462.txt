but we don't support the scalar escape function CONVERT yet.
I get the same result from both the embedded and client driver.

See JDBC 3.0 specification, appendix C.5 for a description of CONVERT and 
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/sql/DatabaseMetaData.html#supportsConvert().

Until we do, we sould return false from supportsConvert().
