Some unary operator nodes with a parameter can be assigned incorrect types during bind time, for example SQRT can become a BOOLEAN expression.

This statement compiles successfully when it should be rejected as SQRT() is not a boolean function.

ij> values case when sqrt then 3 else 4 end;
ERROR 07000: At least one parameter to the current statement is uninitialized.

When a constant is used the correct binding happens.

ij> values case when sqrt(9.0) then 3 else 4 end;
ERROR 42X88: A conditional has a non-Boolean operand. The operand of a conditional must evaluate to TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN.
