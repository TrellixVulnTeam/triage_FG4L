Point where it is not appropriate :


1: Compatibility

The InputStream returned from result set is closed when other getXXXX method was called .
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html

However closing ByteArrayInputStream have no effect at all .
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/ByteArrayInputStream.html#close()

It seems intended that closable InputStream was returned from result set .
If ByteArrayInputStream was returned from result set , the stream cannot be closed, 
and compatibility would be lost .


2: Performance of program 
Information inputted from ByteArrayInputStream needs to be expanded to memory as byte[] object .

If large byte[] object was created for each ByteArrayInputStream object , 
program will run in bad performance .

// I think problem is when information typed as LOB was retrieved from ResultSet .
// Because such informations typed as LOB tend to be large amount .
