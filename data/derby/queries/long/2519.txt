Will attach patch to this issue that does the following clean-up in
the test: 


	Do a transaction rollback in tearDown() before dropping tables.
     This prevents failures when dropping tables due to open result
     sets.




	Commit work in setUp().  Otherwise, the change above may roll
     back the created tables on failure and tearDown() will attempt
     drop non-existing tables.




	Test contains a set of test cases called xTest... that seems to
     originally have been called so because they were excluded from
     running in client/server mode.  They are now run in both embedded
     and client/server so they should be renamed so they are
     automatically made part of the suite.




	ResultSet.update[BC]lob has now been implemented and should be
     used in the above mentioned test cases.
