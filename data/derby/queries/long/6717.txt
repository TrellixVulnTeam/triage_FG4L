Rick noted in DERBY-6648 that if you wanted to grant both SystemPermission("engine", "monitor") and SystemPermission("engine", "usederbyinternals") to a code base, the following would work:

permission org.apache.derby.security.SystemPermission "engine", "monitor,usederbyinternals";

However, the following does not work:

permission org.apache.derby.security.SystemPermission "engine", "usederbyinternals";
permission org.apache.derby.security.SystemPermission "engine", "monitor";
