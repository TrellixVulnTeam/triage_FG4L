When upgrading a database created with Derby 10.1 to 10.2, the SPSs in
the SYSIBM schema are not updated. SYSIBM.METADATA was modified in
DERBY-965, but it still has the old behaviour after the upgrade (both soft and
hard).

How to reproduce:

  1. Create a database with 10.1.

    soft upgrade:

  2. Start 10.2 network server.
  3. Connect to the 10.1 database with the 10.2 client driver and
     invoke DatabaseMetaData.supportsResultSetConcurrency(
     ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY). Return
     value: FALSE.

    hard upgrade:

  4. Restart 10.2 network server.
  5. Connect to the database with "upgrade=true" added to the
     URL. DatabaseMetaData.supportsResultSetConcurrency(
     Restart.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY) returns
     FALSE.

    observe correct behaviour:

  6. Delete the database and recreate it with 10.2.
  7. Start 10.2 network server.
  8. Connect to the database with the client driver and invoke
     DatabaseMetaData.supportsResultSetConcurrency(
     Restart.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY). Return
     value: TRUE.

Proposed solution for hard upgrade: drop and recreate SPSs.

Proposed solution for soft upgrade: read SYSIBM.METADATA from
metadata_net.properties.
