The attached program demonstrates the problem.  Using the ClientConnectionPoolDataSource40 with a connectionEventListener the defined method connectionErrorOccurred is not executed after the Network Server is shutdown and activity is performed on a previously established pooled connection.

Program also demonstrates that the connectionClosed method is executed when the connection is closed.

To run the reproduction:
1) start network server (listening on default host/port and  -noSecurityManager specified)
2) run the program

Output is:
 > java DerbyNotification2
10.3.1.5 - (579866)
