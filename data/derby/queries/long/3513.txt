User reports in an app server environment an intermittent  NullPointerException
with the 10.1 trace:

 R java.lang.NullPointerException
org.apache.derby.iapi.jdbc.BrokeredConnection.newBrokeredStatement(BrokeredConnection.java:448)

...org.apache.derby.jdbc.XAStatementControl.<init>(XAStatementControl.java:62)        
...org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbedXAConnection.wrapStatement(EmbedXAConnection.java:827)  
org.apache.derby.iapi.jdbc.BrokeredConnection.createStatement(BrokeredConnection.java:296)
 [snip user trace]

The code at line 448 is simply:
return new BrokeredStatement(statementControl, getJDBCLevel());

so not much room for an NPE there.   I added println statements to identify the state values and where the NPE is actually occurring but that seemed to make the 
problem go away.  It may be a JIT issue.

I gave them the fix for DERBY-2142 and that did not correct the problem.
