We have seen lots of noise in the nightlies with replication failing. It seems that often it fails due to ports being unavailable, possibly due to earlier (failed) runs.

This JIRA issue tracks diagnostic code I want to insert to see what's happening at test run time.
The diagnostic code can be removed when we have stabilized the tests.
