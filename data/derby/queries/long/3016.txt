The derby instance that has the slave role for a database 'x' has to redo log records sent from the master. These log records are sent in chunks as a byte[]. To be useful to the slave, these chunks of log records must be parsed into individual log records. 

The actual format of the received log record chunks is defined by the replication log buffer (see DERBY-2926).
