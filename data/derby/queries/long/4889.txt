The following code prints "true" with the embedded driver and "false" with the client driver:

        PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement("values cast(? as boolean)");
        ps.setByte(1, (byte) 32);
        ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
        rs.next();
        System.out.println(rs.getBoolean(1));

If setByte() is replaced with setInt(), they both print "true".
