On DERBY-481 Dag points out the following bug:

drop table t1;
drop table t2;

create table t1( a int, b int generated always as ( -a ) );
create table t2( a int, b int );

insert into t2( a, b ) values ( 1, 100 );

– should fail to compile. instead, it compiles but at run time the generation clause
– overrides the value coming from the select
insert into t1 select * from t2;

– should fail to compile. instead, it compiles but at run time the generation clause
– overrides the value coming from the select
insert into t1 select a, 0 from t2;

– should also fail to compile. instead, it compiles but at run time the generation clause
– overrides the value coming from the list of literals
insert into t1 values( 2, 200 );

select * from t1;
