Using the timestampdiff function produces and integer overflow except for very small intervals. Error message is:

[Error Code: -1, SQL State: 22003]  The resulting value is outside the range for the data type INTEGER.

I inserted the following row into my test table:

insert into datetest (ID, 
startdate, 
enddate) values (
5, 
'2006-11-20 04:20:00.0', 
'2006-11-20 04:20:00.2');

This test row works:

select 
{fn timestampdiff(SQL_TSI_FRAC_SECOND, startdate, enddate)}
 as diff from datetest where id = 5

DIFF
200000000

The value also looks too large, which could be exacerbating the problem.
