This test references port 1527; it should use the current test
configuration's method getPort instead, to make it possible to run
several tests on the same machine concurrently.

When I experimented and changed TestConfiguration.DEFAULT_PORT to
something else but 1527, running suites.All crashed in
BadConnectionTest.java, and also crashed the JUnit textui.TestRunner
with this message: "Couldn't get I/O for the connection to:
localhost".  No failure explanation or stack trace was printed on the
console. Not sure why...

Running the test separately, the testrunner survived to show the
failures.
