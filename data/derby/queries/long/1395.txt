Scenario: Both connection and statement are closed and an operation is performed on a closed statement. SQLStates are as follows:

Embedded: SQLSTATE: XJ012, Message: Statement Closed
Client before DERBY-843 fix: SQLSTATE = null, message = Statement closed
Client after DERBY-843 fix: SQLSTATE: 08003, Message: connection closed

This issue is related to the effort started in DERBY-254.
