Network Server should not use the underlying embedded 
Prepared statement when accessing a BrokeredPreparedStatement.

In DERBY-1025 Dan pointed out this code which while not related to DERBY-1025 does appear to be a problem. Here is his comment regarding this code in DRDAStatement:


 /**

	Get prepared statement
*
	@return prepared statement
*/
protected PreparedStatement getPreparedStatement() throws SQLException
{
if (ps instanceof BrokeredPreparedStatement)
return (PreparedStatement)(
((BrokeredPreparedStatement) ps).getStatement());
else
return ps;
}




This code, for some unknown reason due to lack of comments, is getting the underlying embedded statement
from a BrokeredPreparedStatement. This should not be allowed, the BrokeredStatement wrappers are there to
hide the embedded statement object as it can change under the covers of the wrapper.
