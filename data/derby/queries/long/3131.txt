When a database is booted, the page cache and the container cache are given a daemon service to perform operations in the background. This happens in BaseDataFileFactory.postRecovery(). When a new database is created this code is not executed (presumably because we don't perform recovery), so its background cleaner remains inactive until the database is rebooted. The background cleaner should be active after the first boot.
