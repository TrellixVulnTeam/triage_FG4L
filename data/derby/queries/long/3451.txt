In the package org.apache.derby.iapi.error, the class StandardException contains references to following classes:
org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.Util
org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.EmbedSQLException

This is undesirable as it introduces a dependency between StandardException and the implementation of EmbedSQLException.
