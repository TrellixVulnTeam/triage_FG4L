The mailjdbc test uses a hardcoded string 'mailsdb' for the databasename in the compress call in org.apache.derbyTesting.system.mailjdbc.utils.DbTasks:compressTable.

Thus, if one decides to start the network server in a different directory than the client, the compress calls fail.

At least the README.txt should be modified to clarify this.
Alternatively, the test could be modified to create the desired directory structure and start network server if needed.
