Boolean type's correct maximum width is 1.

Seen by the COLUMN_SIZE column from DatabaseMetaData.getColumns returning 0 instead of 1.

Caused by passing a 0 instead of a 1 in SYSAliasesRowFactory, will be fixed by DERBY-1734, which stops
code like this passing in information that is redundant (and hence a chance for it to be wrong).

Don't believe ir has any affect on the runtime behaviour of the system, adding this issue to investigate if an upgrade fix is required
or just leave it at the wrong value for old databases.
