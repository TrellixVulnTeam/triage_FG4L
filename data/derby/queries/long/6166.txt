so 


jdbcapi

    tests implementation of jdbc api such as Connection class implementation, Metadata etc.

    takes from 20 to 40 minutes


jdbc4

    tests implementation of jdbc 4.0

jdk14

    tests implementation of features from the jdk14 specification
nist

    test obtained from the NIST SQL suite v 6.0



derbynetmats

    basic network server tests using the IBM Universal JDBC driver

    variety of tests, including some from derbylang suite

    tested on a variety of hardware takes from 15 to 30 minutes

derbynetautostart

    tests network server functionality without requiring network server framework

largeData

    Contains tests that deal with large amounts of data and thus require more machine resources.  This suite is NOT run as part of 'derbyall' because the tests it contains require either 1) more machine resources than what the typical Derby developer might have, and/or 2) a significant amount of time to run, and thus shouldn't be run every night.

    As tests are added to this quite, it could require more and more time to run (several minutes to several hours to several days), which is why it is NOT included as part of the derbyall suite. Currently the largedata/LobLimits.java test takes about 17Gb of disk space. On a linux machine with 2.8Ghz Intel Xeon CPU, 4Gb RAM , Linux machine and IBM 1.4.2 JVM with default memory heap size, the test ran for about 4.5 hrs. If the test is successful, it will cleanup the database and other files.


aren't needed anymore

also 
db-derby-10.10.1.0-src/BUILDING.html
should be update to support
JUnit 4.x, Ant 1.9  and JDK 1.8 with JDBC 4.2
