NetHarnessJavaTest reuses the old framework test 'testProtocol' via
old framework adapter HarnessJavaTest.
testProtocol uses the class TestProto which hardcodes use of port 1527.
It would be nice to pass the port used in the current TestConfiguration
to testProtocol/TestProto so the JUnit suites can move towards being runnable
with another port than the default. 

Currently, using another port than 1527 for TestConfiguration.DEFAULT_PORT,
 the test fails and crashes JUnit's TestRunner with the console message:

Couldn't get I/O for the connection to: localhost
