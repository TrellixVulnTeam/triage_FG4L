I have a simple program that connects to a database using the Derby Client, executes a simple query, then connects to a different database using a different Connection object and executes another simple query on that second connection.  The queries both execute without error, so it appears that the connections are correct--i.e. each query will only work on one of the databases, and both queries work, therefore each must be getting executed against the correct database.

But in looking at the client and server traces, I noticed that for the query on the second database, the client is actually sending the name of the first database as RDBNAM, which (I think?) is wrong--it should be sending the name of the second database, since the query is being executed on the second Connection object.

This behavior does not appear to occur for JCC.
