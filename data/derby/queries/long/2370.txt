It seems like EXISTS on a SELECT returning zero rows returns false (as
expected), but EXISTS on INTERSECT of two disjunct sets returns true,
e.g EXISTS (values 1 intersect values 2).

I believe its probably got to do with the EXISTS subquery transforming
the original RCL to
a TRUE boolean value for the INTERSECT.  So during row comparison at
execution time
for INTERSECT processing since true == true(thus intersects), so it
will always return 'BAD'.  Likewise,

select * from ( values 'OK' ) as T where exists (values 1 except values 2);

This supposedly should return 'OK' but because of the boolean
transformation mentioned
above for EXISTS subquery, it will return no rows for EXCEPT
processing.
