The localcal demo in the java/demo/localcal source directory (demo/programs/localcal in a Derby distribution) was contributed in 2006 for Derby 10.1.3 and does not seem to have updated since then. It requires the use of third-party software (Google Calendar, among other things). Unless someone is willing to update and maintain it, it seems wise to remove it from the demos. If no volunteer appears in a week or so, I don't mind removing it myself, or someone else can.
