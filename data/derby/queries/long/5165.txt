Steps to reproduce:

1-perform update with XA, using, say Xid xid1
2-prepare xid1 with XA but do NOT commit
3-restart Derby DB
4-the updates of step 1 will be visible

When xid1 is rolled back after step 3 then the updates are gone. So my conclusion is that the transaction is not committed yet, but the updates are visible after prepare. This is a violation of the XA semantics.
