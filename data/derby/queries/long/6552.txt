We simplified and cleaned up the public api in 10.11. Now, however, we've lost the javadoc for methods which customers may need to use. For instance, ClientDataSource contains a method called setSsl() which is inherited from ClientBaseDataSourceRoot. But since ClientBaseDataSourceRoot doesn't appear in the public api, there's no method header comment to consult.
