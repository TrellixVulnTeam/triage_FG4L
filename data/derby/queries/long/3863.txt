The test importExportThruIJ.sql has test cases that try to test functionality not supported by derby.
Various test cases don't match the data, and comments don't reflect the state of the test.

I'm going to create a new test that follows mostly the same lines, but has cleaned up test cases with suitable datasets, and appropriate comments.
I'll backport this to all branches.
