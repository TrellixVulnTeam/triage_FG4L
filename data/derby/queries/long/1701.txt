It looks like the jdbcapi junit suite has been failing on some platforms ever since change: 
r431195 | djd | 2006-08-13 19:08:04 +0200 (Sun, 13 Aug 2006) | 5 lines

Have the test harness jdbcapi run a single JUnit suite jdbcapi._Suite that includes most of the JUnit tests
that were run individually. Tests in this suite that were excluded in derby net or had _app.properties file
now self-exclude themselves based upon the JUnit utility methods indicating which JDBC client they are running.
Remaining JUnit tests should be included in jdbcapi._Suite, think they were added after I has started the _Suite
work.

Here is an example of the diff from the public regression tests:

That is just some of the places I saw it failed.  It failed in my personal test runs on windows XP,  run from sane classes, on single processor laptop.  Failed consistently when run from the derbynetclientsmats suite on 2 trys, and once on a full nightly run.
