Assuming we had a top-level JUnit suite that ran all the Junit tests 
successfully (with the same configuration coverage as they are run today 
in derbyall) switch to a dual testing environment until 
all the tests were converted to JUnit. This would include removing all 
the JUnit tests from the old harness suite files.

That is if one wanted to run all the tests one would have to run:

   derbyall with the old harness
   suites.All using JUnit test runners directly.

Discussion thread is:

Since no objections have been raised I will make progress on this.
