Today we see this warning (well, note) in the javadoc build:

Note: Custom tags that could override future standard tags:  @upgrade, @end_format, @disk_layout, @purpose, @format_id. To avoid potential overrides, use at least one period character (.) in custom tag names.

It would be nice to silence this by doing what's suggested.
