Network client implements setTransactionIsolation() using
Statement.executeUpdate("SET CURRENT ISOLATION.......")
which again causes any active transactions to commit.

This differs from the embedded driver, where setTransactionIsolation() does not cause a commit.

(Note that "SET CURRENT ISOLATION....." will commit active transactions idependent of this)
