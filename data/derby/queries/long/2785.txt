steps to duplicate:

(attach ij to any database)

ij> create table run (i int);
0 rows inserted/updated/deleted
ij> desc run;
ERROR 42X01: Syntax error: Encountered "desc" at line 1, column 1.
ij> 

I think this is a parser problem within ij where the "run" is taken as a token and that token is not included in the definition of a tablename expression in the grammer (should be an easy fix).
