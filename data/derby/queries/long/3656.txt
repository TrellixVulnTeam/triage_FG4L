The message XJ073 says:

 ERROR XJ073: The data in this BLOB or CLOB is no longer available.  The BLOB/CLOB's transaction may be committed, or its connection is closed.

but the lob might also not be available because it has been freed. It would be good to include that possibility in the error message.
