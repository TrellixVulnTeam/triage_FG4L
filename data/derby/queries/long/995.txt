jdbcapi/nullSQLText.java fails in 10.1 branch when run with j9_foundation VM. Reason for failure is the test uses a stored procedure with nested connection. There is no need for a stored procedure with nested connection to test this. Any stored procedure will do. 

This test has been fixed in the trunk and I am attaching the merge command to port the fix to 10.1:
svn merge -r 330704:330705 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/trunk

After merging, I ran the test jdbcapi/nullSQLText.java with j9_foundation. Also ran the test on all 3 frameworks with Sun JDK 1.4.2. I would appreciate if a committer can look at this patch and commit it. Thanks.
