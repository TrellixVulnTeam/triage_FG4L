Scenario:
-connect into database
-use command SET ROLE
-repeat simple selects many times -> memory consumtions ends with database "outOfMemory: heap space" crash.

Sometimes this crash ends with loosing (of course previously commited) data in different tables - this is in the case using "UPDATE" etc. command.
Without command SET ROLE everythings works OK.
