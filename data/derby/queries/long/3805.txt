A simple Blob performance regression test should exist to make it easier to detect performance degradations.
The test should be reasonably quick to complete.

My plan is to focus on embedded first, then continue and enable all tests for client/server if possible.
Depending on the relative performance of embedded and client/server, the parameters might have to be tweaked to achieve an acceptable test duration.

Note that the test results will only be valid for runs performed on the same machine. The intended purpose is to run the test against a clean trunk first, followed by a run with the patch possibly affecting the Blob performance.
Also note that the compared builds must have been built with the same sanity mode.
