On the following table:
   create table tmp (d decimal(31,0));
an insert of a value with a precision larger than 31:
   insert into tmp values (+1.79769E+308);
Should fail with:
   ERROR 22003: The resulting value is outside the range for the data type DECIMAL/NUMERIC(31,0).

However, with jdk15, it does not.

The expected error is generated from org.apache.derby.iapi.types.SQLDecimal.setWidth(), which calls getWholeDigits(), which gets the length of a string based on a BigDecimal using toString, which has a different value using jdk14 vs. jdk15 since the fix for DERBY-38.

Note: I verified that the fix for DERBY-38 did not per se cause this failure.
