I came across this piece of code in TableScanResultSet.getNextRowCore():

						if (past2FutureTbl.get(rowLoc) != null)
						{
							past2FutureTbl.remove(rowLoc);
							continue;
						}

I believe the call to Hashtable.get() is unnecessary since Hashtable.remove() returns the object it removed or null if the key was not in the table. So I believe the code could be simplified like this without changing the behaviour:

    if (past2FutureTbl.remove(rowLoc) != null) 
{
        continue;
    }
