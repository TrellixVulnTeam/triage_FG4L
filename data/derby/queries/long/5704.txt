I noticed a couple of things that could be cleaned up in CoalesceTest:


	It keeps statements in instance variables. These are closed in tearDown(), but not nulled out, so they are not gc'ed when the test completes.




	It has much code that follows the pattern



  try 
{
     s.execute(...);
  }
 catch (SQLException sqle) 
{
     assertSQLState(state, sqle);
  }

which means it won't report a failure if the execution of the statement succeeds unexpectedly.
