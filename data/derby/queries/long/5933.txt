Hello 
I have a simple database with 100 records.
I am running a SQL query from Netbeans GUI though JDBC

This query was generated by Hibernate ORM.

In certain circumstances the result rowset is not sorting.

When I use  condition morefld2_.mf_id in (5) the result is unsortable.
When I use  condition morefld2_.mf_id in (5,0) the result is sorting properly.
