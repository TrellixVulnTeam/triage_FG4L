Presently, Derby accepts WITH DEFAULT USER, but although CURRENT_USER
and SESSION_USER are otherwise used in Derby (see
http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/dev/ref/rrefsqlj42476.html), they can
not presently be used in the column definition. Only USER is allowed.

ISO/IEC 9075-2:2003, section 11.5 <default clause> specifies that all
of the above can be used.
