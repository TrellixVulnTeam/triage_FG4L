The JUnit test environment needs a mechanism to assert/compare SQLStates. The goal is to be able to reference states from SQLState without having to care if the length of the identifier is 5,7 or more characters long.

A way to do this already exist in StandardException.getSQLStateFromIdentifier, but it is too unwieldy and long. I suggest adding  'assertSQLState(String, String, SQLException)' method to BaseJDBCTestCase.
