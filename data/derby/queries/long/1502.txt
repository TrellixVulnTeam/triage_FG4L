Sometimes I see the following failure in lang/grantRevokeDDL.sql. I have seen this on linux under jdk 1.4 and 1.5.

560 del
< ERROR 28508: User 'MAMTA3' does not have select permission on column 'C111' of table 'MAMTA2'.'V22'.

It would appear that when two permissions are inadequate, it's not clear which one will fail the statement.
