Ant scripts are supposed to be self-describing. The following command is supposed to describe the public targets in the current directory:

    ant -projecthelp

Here is the output of this command for the top level build script today:

Main targets:

 checkCompilerLevel     Make sure compiler level is Java 5 level or higher.
 class_size_catalog     create the class size catalog â€“ a java file
 createBranch           Create a new branch (both docs and code)
 parsers                Build the parsers
 release                Build the release distributions
 setCompilerProperties  Set the ant variables which identify the compiler classpaths. Remove the autosetProps logic when this target becomes mandatory.
 setInitialProperties   Set the initial properties for this build script. This duplicates the property setting block in setCompilerProperties. Once we make setCompilerProperties mandatory, this target should be removed.
 state                  Build SanityState.java
Default target: buildsource

That does not seem like the list of public targets to me. This JIRA can be used as a place to anchor work which we do on improving the user documentation for our top level build script.

I propose to make some changes to build.xml. Others are welcome to pile on. Here's how it works:

1) The public targets are the ones which have "description" attributes.

2) So to make a target public, fill in a "description" attribute for it.

3) And to hide a target, move its "description" text into an introductory comment bracketed by "<!-" and "->"
