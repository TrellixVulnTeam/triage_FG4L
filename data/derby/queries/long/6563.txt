NOT elimination for CASE expressions seems to be broken. Take this example:


ij> select * from sysibm.sysdummy1 where not ( case when ibmreqd = 'Y' then true else true end );
IBM&
----
Y   

1 row selected



Both branches of the CASE expression evaluate to TRUE, so one would expect the predicate "not ( case ... )" to evaluate to FALSE, and the query should return an empty result.
