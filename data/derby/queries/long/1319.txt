Docuement the toursdb schema and provide examplet queries so toursdb can be used by newbie Derby users.  To jump start this here is a query that demonstrates how to join the tables in the schema to list the with seats available on a given day from one city to another.  It's not pretty - a good candidate for a view. (sans the hardcoded values listed below:  

This example hardcodes the following string values:
       Travel Date:  '2004-04-12' ,  Departing city: Copenhagen , Destination city: Paris

select  f.flight_id, a.airline_full, 
fa.flight_date|| ' ' || f.depart_time Departing,
    CAST(orig_city.city_name ||', ' || orig_ctry.country as varchar(30)) as Origin, 
   f.flying_time Hours, f.arrive_time Arriving,
   CAST(dest_city.city_name ||', ' || dest_ctry.country as varchar(30))  as Destination
from flights f, airlines a, countries orig_ctry, cities orig_city, 
   countries dest_ctry, cities dest_city, flightavailability fa
where f.flight_id = fa.flight_id and f.segment_number = fa.segment_number
  and orig_city.airport = f.orig_airport and dest_city.airport = f.dest_airport
  and orig_city.country_iso_code = orig_ctry.country_iso_code
  and dest_city.country_iso_code = dest_ctry.country_iso_code
  and f.flight_id like a.airline || '%'
   and fa.flight_date = '2004-04-12' 
  and (a.business_seats - fa.business_seats_taken) > 0
  and orig_city.city_name = 'Copenhagen' and dest_city.city_name = 'Paris'
order by f.flight_id, f.segment_number

NOTE: uses some kludgy formatting tricks

To cut N paste  the query all at once into IJ set maximumdisplaywidth larger (about 985 characters in the query)
