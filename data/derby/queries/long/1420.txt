Andrew had to recently make a checkin # 413411 because JitTest.java prints out Derby version, name and driver name. In order to make the test output independent of Derby releases, I have changed the test to not display Derby version specific info. The patch for that change is attached to this JIRA and it is for the main codeline. If it looks good, then can a commiter please commit this change and merge the test and master changes to Derby 10.1 release as well, if required?
