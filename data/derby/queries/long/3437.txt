Some threads are created for replication purposes:


	The log shipper thread on the master (o.a.d.i.services.master.MasterController)
	The database boot thread on the slave (o.a.d.i.db.SlaveDatabase)
	The log receiver thread on the slave (o.a.d.i.services.slave.SlaveController)



These threads should be given names to simplify debugging.
