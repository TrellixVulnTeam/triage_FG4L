A handful of SQL tests such as jdbcapi/xaAnotherTest.sql fail when run against the jar files.

The output contains lines like

JAVA ERROR: java.lang.NullPointerException

for the ij XA testing commands like xa_datasource

Looks like the derbytools.jar is missing the class
org.apache.derby.impl.tools.ij.xaHelper
since it is loaded indirectly.
