Since 2008-02-29 r632502(DERBY-2109) the compatibility tests run on trunk has reported

'DRDA_InvalidReplyHeader2.S:Invalid reply header from network server: Invalid string . Plaintext connection attempt to an SSL enabled server?'

when doing NetworkServerControl.ping() on trunk against 10.3.2.1 and older servers.

Is this a regression or according to spec?



The compatibility test itself, i.e. the client-server testing is OK.
