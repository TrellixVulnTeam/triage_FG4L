 thes tests on IBM 1.6 fail with:
4d3
< ----- listing properties –
37d35
< ----- listing properties –
71d68
< ----- listing properties –
Test Failed.

	
	
		
		
			End:   sysinfo_withproperties jdk1.6.0 DerbyNetClient
		
		
	
	



Just a difference of how the JVM outputs the property listing.  I think it can be fixed with a sed file.
