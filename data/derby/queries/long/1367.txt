I noticed running  lang./grantrevoke.java with client fails with :
> Unexpected exception

> java.sql.SQLException: Connection authentication failure occurred.  Reason: userid or password invalid.

			End:   grantRevoke jdk1.4.2_07 DerbyNetClient 2006-06-01 12:17:25 ***
		
		
	
	



Perhaps just a test configuration problem of some sort, but  It would be good to have client testing for  grant revoke.
