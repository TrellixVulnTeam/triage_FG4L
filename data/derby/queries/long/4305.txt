The class org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.j9_foundation11 was created to support running derbyall with IBM's implementation of the CDC profile. To support this, some assumptions regarding paths were made, and this is reflected in comments and paths in the class.

The current implementation reflects weme6.1 - which is about 2 years old. I'd like to upgrade to weme6.2.2 to take advantage of any bug fixes.

I believe there is currently no implementation for PhoneME in the old harness - the testing instructions on the wiki page only reflect running suites.All, so I'm hoping there are no objections to this change...
