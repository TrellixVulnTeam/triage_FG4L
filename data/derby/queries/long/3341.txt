Defining a column in the returned type as CHAR(10) requires that the returned value be of length 10 characters.

Defining a table function with a return type of:
   returns TABLE  column0 char( 10 ), column1 char( 10 ))
seems to just return whatever the Java ResultSet implementation handed it.

My guess this is true for all variable length types, no casting of the value occurs when it is returned to the SQL domain.

Java single value functions and procedure out parameters do perform any required casting to ensure the value is of the declared type.
