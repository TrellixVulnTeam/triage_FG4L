The functionality of creating a tracefile for the output currently works with DriverManager connections, by using tracefile=<filename> as well as with all DataSources when using the setting ds.setTraceFile("<filename>"). However, using tracefile="filename" only works as a connection attribute with ClientDataSource, not with ClientConnectionPoolDataSource nor ClientXADataSource.

For completeness' sake it would be nice if this were supported.

See for a test of this functionality jdbcapi/checkDataSource.java.
