As described in the JDBC 4 spec, sections 20.1, 20.2, and 3.1.

The Ease of Development extensions provide a way to create tabular DataSets from queries and tuple signatures. The jdk ships with a factory for creating these DataSets, which is a class which implements the QueryObjectGenerator interface. A database can write its own custom QueryObjectGenerator, or just ship with the default, jdk-shipped version. For this task, we will simply wire the default jdk-shipped factory into the appropriate methods: Connection.createQueryObject() and DataSource.createQueryObject().
