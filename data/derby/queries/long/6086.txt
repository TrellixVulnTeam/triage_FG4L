There is quite a bit of common boilerplate code in jdbcapi.StatementPoolingTest related to getting a custom connection, or rather more than one logical connection from a single pooled (physical) connection.

This could be factored out to make the test methods shorter, and to make the test methods more focused on whatever they're testing.
