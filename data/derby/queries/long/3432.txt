The replication source code is currently in package org.apache.derby.
{impl|iapi}.services.replication, but the services package is intended for low-level self-contained modules. Since the replication code is highly integrated with the store modules, the replication code should be moved to org.apache.derby.{impl|iapi}
.store.replication.
