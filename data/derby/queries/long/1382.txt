The documentation for 10.1 
(http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.1/adminguide/cadminappsclientdiffs.html)
states:

  "Scrollable cursors (ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE or
  ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE) are not supported using the
  network client if the result set contains LOB
  data. TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY must be specified for result sets containing
  LOB data."

Unfortunately, this is not signalled when one tries to use it, it just fails silently,
cf. repro program.  Either this should be implemented, or we should throw a
not implemented exception.  For JDBC4 compliancy, it needs to be fixed, I
think.
