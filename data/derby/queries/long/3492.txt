In MasterController#appendLog, log is force-sent to the slave if the replication log buffer becomes full. However, the log chunk that should have been appended is discarded:

try {
     logBuffer.appendLog(greatestInstant, log, logOffset, logLength);
} catch (LogBufferFullException lbfe) {
     try 
{
         logShipper.forceFlush();
     }
 catch (IOException ioe) {
...
}

The log chunk must be added after freeing a log buffer by calling forceFlush
