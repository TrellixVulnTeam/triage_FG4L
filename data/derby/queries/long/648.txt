'show connections' statement throws the following exception when run in CDC/FP with JSR169: "JAVA ERROR: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java/sql/DatabaseMetaData.getURL()Ljava/lang/String;"

This is because java/sql/DatabaseMetaData.getURL() method is not available in JSR169. In JSR169, DataSource has to be used to get a connection and this does not use a URL. So this method is not available.

Currently, 'show connections' displays connection names along with the URLs used to get the connections. When DataSource is used to get connection (ij.dataSource property is set), I plan to change this to display only connection names. With this change, around 7 tests can be enabled to run in CDC/FP.
