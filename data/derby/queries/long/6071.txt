With trunk svn updated to revision 1445458, the javadoc build on windows fails with an error like:

[path_to_trunk]\build.xml:1388: Javadoc failed: java.io.IOException:
Cannot run program "[path_to_ibm16jvm]\bin\javadoc.exe": CreateProcess
error=206, The filename or extension is too long.

This is in the testingdocs target.
It appears a new test causes the javadoc name to be too long for windows javadoc.
The solution is to add a property, 'useexternalfiles=yes'.
Other javadoc targets, e.g. derbydocs and demodocs, already have this property.
