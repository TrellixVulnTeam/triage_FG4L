Since dropping roles and revoking role grants (and setting the current
role) can effect dependent objects, we need to track such
dependencies. Derby already has a system for this, so we make the role
descriptor as Provider in that system. This allows us to track
dependencies that view, constraints and triggers, as well
prepared statements and/or activations, may have on roles.
