The org.apache.derbyTesting.junit package currently compiles against the JDK 1.4 classpath. Since these classes need to run on CDC/FP 1.1 platforms, they should be compiled against the small device classpath. That will make the compiler raise an error when the JUnit infrastructure references methods which are not present on small devices.
