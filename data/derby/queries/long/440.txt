The derby.jar is correctly created by the top-level buil.xml with the attribute filesonly=true.
However the subsequent update of the jar file to add the locale files, partially extracted here, does not include the filesonly attribute, so the directory entries are added in.

around line 757 

   <jar destfile="$
{derby.jar.dir}
/derby.jar"
        update="true"
        compress="true">

Adding    filesonly="true" to this target solved the problem.

Similar changes are probably needed for the other derby jar files and should be addressed with this bug
