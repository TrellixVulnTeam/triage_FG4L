As part of implementing the overall OLAP Operations features of SQL (DERBY-581), implement the ROW_NUMBER() window function.

More information about this feature is available at http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/OLAPRowNumber

DERBY-2998 implements 

	framework code for windows and window function result columns.
	the ROW_NUMBER() window function according to SQL2003
but the implementation is limited by
	only supporting an empty, unnamed, inline window definition (i.e the full, unordered resultset)
	not being fully optimized
