I did a SANE build against a newly created client on trunk and go no errors.
I then did an ant refreshjardriftcheck, and it generated a change to 
sane.derbyTesting.jar.lastcontents to be checked in, it is included at end of description.

There seems to be 2 problems here:
1) sane.derbyTesting.jar.lastcontents checked in version is likely out of date and needs to be updated.
2) The build should notice it is out of date and fail.

I was led to this as I am working on a change that did add files to derby.jar
but was confused that it was generating changes for derbyTesting.jar in my own development client.  This is why I tried it on a clean client and ran refresh even though build was clean.
