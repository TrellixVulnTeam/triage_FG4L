BACKGROUND:

Derby has a defined set of SQL statements that are used to return metadata about a given database.  These statements are the basis on which many of the Java methods in the java.sql.DatabaseMetaData class are implemented.  For example, DatabaseMetaData.getColumns() is ultimately mapped to a call to a SQL statement called "getColumns" that is defined in the file: 

java\engine\org\apache\derby\impl\jdbc\metadata.properties 

As can be seen from its definition, this statement returns a result set that agrees with the result set defined for the Java getColumns() method. 

The ODBC equivalent to DatabaseMetaData is a set of ODBC methods that offer similar functionality.  For example, the ODBC equivalent to "DatabaseMetaData.getColumns()" is the ODBC call "SQLColumns()". 

PROBLEM: 

Right now, all metadata SQL statements return result sets that match the Java/JDBC standard, since in the past, Derby has only been used by JDBC drivers.  However, now that Cloudscape/Derby has beta support for ODBC clients (via Network Server; see http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/db2/library/techarticle/dm-0409cline2/index.html), and since the expected result sets for ODBC are different in some ways than those for JDBC, Derby metadata calls need to expand to accommodate ODBC clients. 

An example of the need for this change can be found using Microsoft Access: if one tries to do a "table link" or "import" to a Derby database via Network Server (using the DB2 ODBC driver), the attempt will fail with "Reserved Error (-7734); there is no message for this error".  It turns out that the cause of this problem is the metadata result set mentioned above.

PROPOSAL:

What I would like to propose is that we add support in the Derby engine to allow the metadata methods to return result sets in two forms: one that conforms to the JDBC standard (which is what we do currently; that would be the default), and another that conforms to the ODBC standard.  For more info on the latter, see the following link:

Metadata calls over Network Server are executed via system procedures that are built-in to Derby-and these system procedures then map to the SQL statements mentioned above.  The procedures already have an "OPTION" parameter that accepts a string parameter, so what I would propose is that we add logic to recognize a "DATATYPE" keyword as part of this stringbasically, if we see the string "DATATYPE='ODBC'" in the OPTION parameter, then the stored procedure would map to a new set of SQL statements in the "metadata.properties" file-and these new statements would return result sets that conform to the ODBC standard.  Otherwise, if "DATATYPE='JDBC'" or else no DATATYPE keyword is specified, the current SQL metadata statements would be used by default.
