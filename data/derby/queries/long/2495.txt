The client JDBC driver will need to call stored procedures (ref DERBY-2257) to operate on LOBs identified by locators.  We should create a framework that implement the stored procedure calls.  This way, the rest of the client code can call methods in this framework when needing to call the stored procedures without having to prepare SQL statements themselves.  

The framework should make sure that prepared statements are reused within a connection.  Each procedure call should only be prepared once per connection.

Since LOBs can not be parameters to stored procedures, the framework should make sure that calls involving a byte[] or String that does not fit in a VARCHAR (FOR BIT DATA), are split into several calls each operating on a fragment of the LOB.
