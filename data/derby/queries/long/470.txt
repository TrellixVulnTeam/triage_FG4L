As I did not get any response to my mail, I am opening a JIRA issue for this.

When I run the test i18n/I18NImportExport.java with JSR169 using IBM's J2ME/CDC/Foundation Profile, I get the following exception:
"JAVA ERROR: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java/sql/ResultSet.getBigDecimal(II)Ljava/math/BigDecimal;"

In the test, LOCALIZEDDISPLAY is on and the table has a DECIMAL column. This causes the exception. On looking at the code, following is done to format DECIMAL types in LocalizedResource:

if (type == Types.NUMERIC || type == Types.DECIMAL) { 
      return  getNumberAsString(rs.getBigDecimal(columnNumber, rsm.getScale(columnNumber)));
}

where getNumberAsString method does the following:

public String getNumberAsString(Object o){
      if (enableLocalized)
{
            return formatNumber.format(o, new StringBuffer(), new FieldPosition(0)).toString();
      }
      else 
{
            return o.toString();
      }
 }

As a solution, I am planning to do the following:
1. Check for BigDecimal class in the JVM by doing a Class.forName
2. Call getNumberAsString for NUMERIC and DECIMAL types only if BigDecimal class is available. Otherwise, return rs.getString.

This solution would mean that NUMERIC and DECIMAL types will not  be localized in these JVM environments. Please let me know if any comments on this.

Thanks,
Deepa
