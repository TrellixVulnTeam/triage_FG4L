Derby only has partial support for retrieving generated values. 
Because of this, it is desirable to make 
DatabaseMetaData.supportsGetGeneratedKeys return FALSE. One 
of the restrictions include Jira entry Derby-201. Till this is 
fixed, we should change derby to return FALSE for this.

This would also match Derby client behavior.
