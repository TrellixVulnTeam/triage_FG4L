If you invoke a table function as a scalar function, Derby instantiates the ResultSet returned by the table function and returns that ResultSet. This behavior looks wrong. Derby should raise an error if you invoke a table function as a scalar function. Here is an example of the problem:

ij> values ( badVTI( 'foo' ) );
1
