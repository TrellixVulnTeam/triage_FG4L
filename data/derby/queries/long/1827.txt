DatabasePropertyTestSetup.tearDown method resets properties to null if the property was not set before. Setting to null may not be supported for all properties. This gives an exception for 'derby.database.sqlAuthorization' property. See http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1522#action_12433121
