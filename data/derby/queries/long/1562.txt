Most JDBC tests that extend BaseJDBCTestCase  have their own connection field and their own tearDown method to close the connection, this is all common code that should be in the base class. Once the getConnection method becomes an instance method (rather than a static method see DERBY-1555) then it could create the connection on demand.
