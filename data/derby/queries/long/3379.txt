This is the client version of bug DERBY-2142.  It can be reproduced by enabling the test, DataSourceTest.testPooledReuseOnClose() for client. I am opening a new issue for client as the embedded fix was backported to 10.1 and I am guessing the client fix won't be backported that far.  Better to keep it as  a separate issue.
