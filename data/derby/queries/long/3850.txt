After the fix for DERBY-177 and DERBY-3693 was committed, these code clean-ups could be performed:


	remove workaround for DERBY-177 in the tests (search for the string "DERBY-177" to find them)




	remove logic to prevent waiting for table locks in SPSDescriptor.updateSYSSTATEMENTS() since the new mechanism will prevent waiting for all types of locks
