Many of derbyall fails at Japanese localed Windows when environment corresponding derbyLocale_JP.jar exists in CLASSPATH.
Almost all of derby_all was failed because all result message was generated in 
Japanese , and that was different from master file.

I tried next configuration ...

conf_0:Exclude derbyLocale_jp.jar
conf_1:Add option "-Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US"
conf_2:Add option "-Djvmflags=-Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US"
conf_3:Defiine environment variable _JAVA_OPTIONS=:-Duser.language=en -Duser.locale=us
conf_4:Defiine environment variable LC_CTYPE:en_US

conf_0 works well on derbyall suite but some of derbynetclientmats/derbynetmats in derbyall suite was failed. Network module seems to have localed message in other resource.
conf_1 works on derbynetclientsmats suite, but same configuration for derbyall suite does not work at all.
conf_2 does not work on derbynetclientsmats suite.
conf_3 seems to work for locale problem but  "Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS:" message cause error in test.
conf_4 does not works ...

Now conf_0 seems to be reasonable method now.
I think conf_3 may be reasonable direction to modify test suite.
