The problem reported by Knut Anders Hatlen in DERBY-646 is caused by improper handling of the temporary directory created for the database.
A NullPointerException was thrown on database shutdown.

After studying the code, I believe it is wise to follow the approach taken by the base storage factory;
 o locate the temporary directory within the database directory
    (i.e. for database 'mydb' this will by 'mydb/tmp')
 o don't create the temporary directory before Derby supplies a unique name to the storage factory
