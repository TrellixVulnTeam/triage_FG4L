We already allow the use of methods and classes that only exist in Java 5 and higher in code that only runs at build time, but java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/build.xml specifies source and target level "1.4", so we cannot use the new syntax introduced in Java 5. I think we should also change source and target level to allow the new (well, not so new anymore...) language constructs.

(I noticed this when I started writing code to perform sanity checking of the message files at build time (DERBY-4796) and couldn't use the simpler for loop syntax.)
