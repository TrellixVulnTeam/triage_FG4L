I downloaded a Cloudescape Version 10 from here http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/db2/library/techarticle/dm-0408cline/index.html.  Not sure exactly which version of 10 this is.

Would like to store up to a 10MB XML string in a CLOB.  However, I noticed it took over 3 minutes to insert a 500kb string.  I am using the PreparedStatement to get around the 37kb limitation encountered in a previous issue.  It takes less than 2 seconds to insert a 500kb string into a CLOB in mySQl.

Here the snippet:

      FileReader fr = new FileReader ("sample.txt");  
      BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);
      String record = null;
      try {

        while ( (record=br.readLine()) != null ) 
{

          bufferStr.append( record );

      }

      } catch (IOException e) 
{
      //
      // put your error-handling code here
      //
         System.out.println("Error reading file");
      }


      System.out.println("Size of inputStr: "+bufferStr.length() );

      PreparedStatement ps = mm.connection.prepareStatement("INSERT into  documents           VALUES (?,?)" );
      ps.setInt(1, 13 );
      StringReader reader1 = new StringReader(bufferStr.toString());
      ps.setCharacterStream(2, reader1, bufferStr.length());
      System.out.println("Uploading string....");
      ps.execute();
      System.out.println("Done uploading string...");
      mm.connection.commit();


Thanks for your the help,
