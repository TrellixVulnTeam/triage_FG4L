The SQL standard doesn't allow non-deterministic function calls in the operands of NULLIF. Derby does however allow such calls, but the results may not be as one might expect.

Take an expression such as NULLIF(expr, 1). It shouldn't ever return 1. If expr is 1, it should return NULL, and if expr is not 1, it should return expr.

If expr contains a call to a non-deterministic function, it may actually end up returning 1 sometimes:


ij> SELECT NULLIF(INT(RANDOM()*2), 1) FROM SYS.SYSTABLES;
