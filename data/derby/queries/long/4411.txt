This sequence of statements causes an error because the scalar sub-query supposedly doesn't return exactly one row, even though it does return exactly one row:

ij> create table t (x int unique, y int);
0 rows inserted/updated/deleted
ij> insert into t values (1,2);
1 row inserted/updated/deleted
ij> select * from t where x > (values 1 union select y from t where 1=0);
ERROR 21000: Scalar subquery is only allowed to return a single row.
ij> values 1 union select y from t where 1=0;
1          
-----------
1          

1 row selected

Before DERBY-4391, the problematic statement would have caused a NullPointerException.
