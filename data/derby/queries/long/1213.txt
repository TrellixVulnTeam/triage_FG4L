In order to get rid of the inconsistent  regression test results reported in DERBY-990 and DERBY-1210, removed the following 
from the access.sql script.  This methodology has been problematic and multiple "hacks" have been put in to try and get the
results reproducible.  The results are very timing dependent on background threads.   The test probably should be rewritten
as a .java program and at the very least report the differences in space management in the error (rather than the lazy approach
used because logic was not possible in a .sql script).

Here is the original scripting:
— buddy test case for reclaiming deleted rows during split.
— test space reclamation using the SpaceTable VTI.
—    o insert bunch of rows with sequential keys.
—    o create non-unique index.
—    o check space usage for index using SpaceTable VTI
—    o delete every other one less than 1000 - this will make normal post
—      commit not fire as no page should have all deleted rows (< 1000 avoids
—      possible case where last page only has 1 row).
—    o commit
—    o now reinsert rows into the "holes" which before the fix would cause
—      splits, but now will force reclaim space and reuse existing space in
—      btree.
—    o redo delete, commit and insert several times over
—    o check space usage for index using SpaceTable VTI is same as above

— set page size to default.
