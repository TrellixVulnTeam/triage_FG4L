The base class for the replication tests, ReplicationRun, keeps references to connections used during the test also after the test has completed. The connections are referenced from these fields:


	masterConn
	slaveConn
	startSlaveException (which references a connection indirectly via client.am.SqlException -> client.am.Sqlca)
