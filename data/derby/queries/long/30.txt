JDBC 3.0 Javadoc for java.sql.Connection.close() states

"Calling the method close on a Connection object that is already closed is a no-op."

In Derby embedded calling close on a closed connection from the DriverManager or EmbeddedDataSource incorrectly throws XJ012.

Calling close on a closed connection from a ConnectionPoolDataSource or XADataSource for Derby correctly returns correctly (no-op).

Similar issue for Statement.close() - needs to be a no-op on a closed Statement/PreparedStatement/CallableStatement
