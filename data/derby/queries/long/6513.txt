When I build the 10.10 branch using JDK 8, I see the following warnings:


    [javac] warning: [options] source value 1.4 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
    [javac] warning: [options] target value 1.4 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
    [javac] warning: [options] To suppress warnings about obsolete options, use -Xlint:-options.
    [javac] 3 warnings
