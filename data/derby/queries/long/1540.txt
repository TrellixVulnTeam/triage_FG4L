The test jdbc4/TestQueryObject runs without the security manager because the default QueryObjectGenerator uses reflection.
See  trunk/java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbc4/TestQueryObject_app.properties

Seems like a bug, but not sure of its cause or solution: Could be one (or none) of:


	Make changes in Derby code, e.g. add privilege blocks but don't see how this will solve anything as it's not Derby code that's calling the reflection and I don't see any javadoc comments in JDBC 4.0 about methods throwing SecurityExceptions.




	document the privileges required to use the EoD features, though not sure how we would document the ability to grant a privilege to system (JDK) code. Are these privileges documented in the JDBC spec?




	a bug in the Mustang beta, default query object not being treated as system code, no priv blocks in it?




	a limitation of the default  QueryObjectGenerator , cannot use with a security manager?




	a Derby test problem?



This is more of a tracking issue, with a dump of my thoughts.
