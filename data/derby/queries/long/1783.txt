There is a logical error in the following function in DirFile4.java
for determining which mode to use when opening a new log file:

    public StorageRandomAccessFile getRandomAccessFile( String mode) throws FileNotFoundException
    
{
        // Assume that modes "rws" and "rwd" are not supported.
        if(!rwsOK && "rws".equals( mode) || "rwd".equals( mode))
            mode = "rw";
        return new DirRandomAccessFile4( (File) this, mode);
    }
 // end of getRandomAccessFile

The expression in the if test is missing parentheses around the OR
expression making it return the wrong value for one case. If "rwd"
mode is requested for the file (and this is supported by the JVM), the
file is opened with "rw" instead of "rwd".

NOTE: this bug does not effect any current Derby versions since as far
as I know "rwd" is never used for log files. I came across it when
experimenting with using "rwd" for the log.
