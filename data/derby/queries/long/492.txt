Server hangs in communication with client when it (the server) tries to send a DSS continuation header to accommodate a high number (hundreds) of return columns from a Java procedure. Problem appears to be in the way the server creates the DSS continuation header. Repro can be found in the "stored_proc_repro.java" file, which uses the stored procedure "LOTS_O_COLS" declared in "storedProcs.java". Both files are attached to this bug.
