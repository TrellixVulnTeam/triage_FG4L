The initInfo method of CatalogRowFactory takes a set of index column positions and index names. I was going to remove the passing of column names and instead get the names from the SystemColumn array returned by buildColumnList.
Prior to that I added some code to check the existing index names passed in matched the names in the SystemColumn array and found there were mismatches, e.g.

checking SYSCONGLOMERATES
MISMATCH SYSCONGLOMERATES
  CONGLOMERATEID
  CONGLOMERATE_ID
MISMATCH SYSCONGLOMERATES
  CONGLOMERATENAME
  CONGLOMERATE_NAME
checking SYSSCHEMAS
checking SYSCONSTRAINTS
checking SYSKEYS
checking SYSDEPENDS
checking SYSALIASES
checking SYSVIEWS
checking SYSCHECKS
checking SYSFOREIGNKEYS
checking SYSSTATEMENTS
MISMATCH SYSSTATEMENTS
  STMTID
  STATEMENTID
checking SYSFILES
checking SYSTRIGGERS
MISMATCH SYSTRIGGERS
  TABLEID
  CREATIONTIMESTAMP

Looking further to see why these mismatches did not cause problems or what hdden problems they  might be causing I found they are stored in an IndexInfoImpl class but never used.
