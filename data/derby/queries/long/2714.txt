The first test case in SecureServerTest expects the network server to fail during start-up and tries to ping the server for five minutes before it concludes that the server didn't start. This seems unnecessarily long. If NetworkServerTestSetup.pingForServerStart() had a reference to the Process object for the server process, it could conclude much sooner that the network server process had terminated and would not respond.
