In the CLASSPATH example in section 2.1 derbyTesting.jar is refered to as beeing the same path as jakarta-oro-2.0.8.jar and junit.jar. When I build Derby with ant the derbyTesting.jar is created in ./jars/sane/ which which resembels $jardir and not $tstjardir

So for the pleasure of copy pasteing I changed the example to reflect this. I do not know if my assumption that derbyTesting.jar often will be in the same directory as derby.jar etc. is correct. The important thing is that it is in the $CLASSPATH.
