The synchronization in BasicDependencyManager is prone to deadlock, because database locks are obtained while holding the monitor on "this".
Problem observed when testing the automatic index statistics update prototype.

There are comments in the file suggesting that in-memory dependencies should be accessed while holding the Java monitor, but the monitor should not be held when accessing stored dependencies. The implementation is breaking this rule/suggestion.
