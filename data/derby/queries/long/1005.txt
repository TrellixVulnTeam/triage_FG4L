Holdability for a connection should automatically become CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT for a global transaction.
For client xa Connection.getHoldability returns OLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT within a global transaction.

This issue was discovered when converting checkDataSource30.java to run with client and related code was disabled for client testing.

To reproduce,  take out if (TestUtil.isEmbeddedFramework())   for this code in jdbcapi/checkDataSource30.java

if (TestUtil.isEmbeddedFramework())
			{
				// run only for embedded
				// Network XA BUG: getHoldability does not return CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT for global transaction
				System.out.println("Notice that connection's holdability at this point is CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT because it is part of the global transaction");
				System.out.println("CONNECTION(in xa transaction) HOLDABILITY " + (conn1.getHoldability() == ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT));
			}
