UpdatableBlobStream and ClobUpdatableReader have a maxPos field which tells when to stop reading the underlying stream regardless of whether or not end-of-stream has been reached. If there is no limit, maxPos is set to -1. If we instead set maxPos to infinity (Long.MAX_VALUE is close enough), the special handling of maxPos==-1 could be removed.
