SQLSTATE(XJ05C): Cannot set holdability ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT for
 a global transaction.

Exception is thrown in client, in embedded the statement executes successfully.
Since HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT  only applies to ResultSets  and executeUpdate states it only succeeds if the statement
does not generate ResultSets, then this combination should succeed.

Probably related to the fact that in embedded an execute() call on the same PreparedStatement will thrown a  XJ05C exception

Workaround is to prepare the statement explicitly with CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT.
