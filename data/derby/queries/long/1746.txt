The upgrade test' master is based on the 10.1 jars checked in to svn -  10.1.1.0 - (208786). 
However, we now have a newer released version of 10.1 - 10.1.3.  This would be the obvious choice for someone running tests testing the beta jars.

If the jars are 10.1.3 then a diff will occur because of the fix for DERBY-655:
703d702
< ,APP,DERBY655T2,C21_ID,,APP,DERBY655T1,C11_ID,1,3,0,F_12,xxxxGENERATED-IDxxxx, 7
2168d2166
< ,APP,DERBY655T2,C21_ID,,APP,DERBY655T1,C11_ID,1,3,0,F_12,xxxxGENERATED-IDxxxx, 7

It would be nice if the final build for 10.2 would include an updgrade test master created using 10.1.3, And same is true for the trunk.
