I was writing some tests for the Scrollable updatable ResultSet feature, and  found some tests failing with 

ERROR XCL07: Cursor 'SQLCUR0' is closed. Verify that autocommit is OFF.

in ResultSet.updateRow(). 

The test does the following:
1. set up a connection, and run a query which selects one tuple
2. update the tuple using updateXXX and updateRow
3. rollback the transaction and close the connection

Then, repeat the process, however this time use a different string in the query.  This time updateRow() may fail with the error above. 

The problem has been reproduced on forward only, updatable resultsets.

Workaround:
It does not seem to fail if I
a, set another cursorname on the statement object,
b, use the same query string.

I will attach the program to reproduce the problem. Below is the output:
