Running suites.All with IBM 1.5  on 10.5.0.0 alpha - (743198)  I got a hang in the test run.  The last test to run successfully was xtestNestedSavepoints, but I am not sure exactly what test caused  the hang.  I took a thread dump which I will attach, which showed network server up and running but no ClientThread and a ping attempt blocked.

This hang is very similar to the hang that was seen after the fix attempts for DERBY-1465 but that change was backed out so it is not related to that change.   It could be that the change for DERBY-1465 just made this highly intermittent problem more likely.
