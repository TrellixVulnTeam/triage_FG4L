With changes to derby-962, the client would default to eusridpwd if the client jvm supports it.  It is not sufficient to only check if client jvm can support eusridpwd  but we need to verify if the server can support the particular secmec.  

There are other existing jiras DERBY-1675,DERBY-1517,DERBY-1755 that will help to address the issue of  upgrading to a better security mechanism.

This jira will change the default security mechanism to 3 as it was before derby-962 changes.
