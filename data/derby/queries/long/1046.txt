The JVMInfo class is included twice in derbyclient.jar, as
org.apache.derby.iapi.services.info.JVMInfo and
org.apache.derby.shared.common.info.JVMInfo. The only one of them
actually used by the client code is the one found in
org.apache.derby.shared.common.info.

org.apache.derby.iapi.services.info.JVMInfo is also included in
derby.jar, so one could run into problems if the classpath contains
derbyclient.jar and derby.jar with different versions.
