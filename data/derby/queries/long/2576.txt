After implementing setCreateDatabase for ClientDataSource, and creating a test (see DERBY-2296) I realized there was no such test for XADataSource or ConnectionPoolDataSource.
However, the test I created failed with Embedded, because the database does not get created. A database does get created using setConnectionAttributes(create=true). 
Also, setShutdownDatabase does work (tested in XADSAuthenticationTest and PoolDSAuthenticationTest).
