When specifying a trace file with the traceFile connection URL attribute or with the data source setter method, the handle to the trace file isn't released when the physical connection is closed.
The problem may be specific to the implementations of ConnectionPoolDataSource and XADataSource, as using a plain data source doesn't involve reuse (i.e another mechanism may close the trace file handle).

Two potential problems caused by this bug:
 o resource leak  (i.e., too many file handles open)
 o trace files cannot be deleted on Windows (seen for DERBY-4709)
