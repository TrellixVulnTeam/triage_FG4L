The community should agree on a name for the subSubProtocol for the in-memory back end. The name will be used in the connection URL, and it is the mechanism used to tell Derby to use the in-memory back end:
jdbc:derby:subSubProtocol:dbName

Two hot candidates are:
 o mem
 o memory

The former is shorter, the latter is slightly more descriptive. If you have opinions on this, please post a comment.
We should decide on this before we cut the branch for 10.5.
