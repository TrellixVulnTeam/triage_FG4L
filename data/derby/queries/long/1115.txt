After finding, in my and others' code, a number of situations where we used a message id with no matching message, or used the incorrect number of parameters for an internationalized message, I became determined to write a test that tries to track down these bugs, a kind of "i18n lint".  

It's very hard, almost impossible, to test these invocations of message formatting through a normal  unit test, because basically you have to write a full suite of negative tests.

This bug is a placeholder for some work I am doing to accomplish this task using code parsing rather than trying to execute negative tests.
