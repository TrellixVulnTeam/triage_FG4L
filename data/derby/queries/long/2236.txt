The problem has been observed in nightly tests run on SLES with JDK1.4.2. The triggering factor seems to be that derbyrun.jar comes before derby.jar in the classpath. The problem seems very similar to JIRA1883, it is the same three tests that are failing, but this time it is derbyrun.jar that comes before derby.jar in the classpath. I have tested a fix in the policy file by giving derbyrun.jar the permissions that were given to derbynet.jar in JIRA1883 (reading properties), and that seems to solve the problem.
