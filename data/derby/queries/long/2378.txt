Functional tests should not be written against Derby's public api, not its internals.
One reason is that it will make it harder to run the tests against different versions of Derby to test for regressions (e.g. run 10.3 tests against 10.4)

The code imports these classes that are not part of the public api.

import org.apache.derby.iapi.reference.Property;
import org.apache.derby.iapi.tools.i18n.LocalizedResource;
import org.apache.derby.impl.drda.NetworkServerControlImpl;
