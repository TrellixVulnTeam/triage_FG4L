In http://www.nabble.com/Problem%3A-Communication-Link-Failure--derby.drda.timeSlice-p5966781.html , Hannes Grund reported a problem with derby.drda.timeSlice property.

I tried this property in my environment on trunk (10.3) and hit several communication failure problems with the following errors below.

In some cases, the client gets the 58009 communications error.

ERROR 58009: A communications error has been detected: Software caused connection abort: recv failed.

I am opening this jira because it seems like the basic problem may be just in the way the timeSlice property is being handled.  As part of this jira, make sure that the timeSlice property behaves the way it is expected to and also clarify the documentation. 

The documentation currently states this "Use the derby.drda.timeslice property to set the number of milliseconds that each connection will use before yielding to another connection. " and the default value is 0. Not clear what it means to have a default of 0. I think it is good to explain the behavior here.
