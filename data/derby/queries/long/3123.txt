Most HTML files describing demos in the demo directory contain a reference to the style sheet "csfull.css". In a Derby -bin distribution this file is located in the demo/programs/ directory. In the source tree, this file is located in the java/demo/ directory. The references to this file have relative paths, such as "../csfull.css". Some of the references are incorrect, because they are pointing to the wrong relative directory. 

The consequences are that the pages are displayed in the browser without the intended style, and that there is an inconsistent style in use among the demos (because some references work while others don't).

[demo]$ find . -name "*.html" | xargs grep "csfull.css"
./toursdb/toursdb_readme.html:<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../../csfull.css" title="toursdb">
./workingwithderby/readme.html:<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../csfull.css" title="sample">
./nserverdemo/readme.html:<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../csfull.css" title="sample">
./simple/example.html:<link rel="StyleSheet" href="../../csfull.css" type="text/css" media="screen">
./demo.html:<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../csfull.css" title="sample">
./navbar.html:<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../csfull.css" title="sample">

The above reveals that the CSS reference is wrong in the following files:
    toursdb/toursdb_readme.html
    simple/example.html
    demo.html
    navbar.html
