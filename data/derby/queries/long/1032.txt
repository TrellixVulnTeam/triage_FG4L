Scripts for Derby should be written to follow common practice at Apache. This means locating them in a bin directory, and self configuring from the minimum amount of information necessary: installation location and in our case, the location of Java, from the variables DERBY_HOME and JAVA_HOME respectively. If these variables are not set, we should report this to the user. Good examples are available in Ant, Forrest, and Maven, and much of the same setup code can be reused from those projects.
