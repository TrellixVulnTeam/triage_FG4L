The collation methods in Derby should follow the rules defined by SQL spec in Section 9.13 Collation determination Syntax Rules 2 and 3e. 

According to those rules, 
1)***at least one operand*** shall have a declared type collation (that means if the comparison is sysChar1|userChar1 > sysChar2|userChar2, then such a comparison will fail because both sides of > operator have collation derivation of NONE. 

Derby doesn't yet enforce this rule of having atleast one operand with non-NONE collation derivation when working with collation operation.
