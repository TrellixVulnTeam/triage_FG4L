Several of the Derby samples and demos call Class.forName to load the JDBC driver, although this is not necessary at Java SE 6 and later. Since at 10.11 we won't support versions of the platform earlier than JDK 6, these calls should be removed from the samples (and any mention of them removed from the accompanying documentation).

There are calls to Class.forName that load other objects besides the driver; I assume these are still needed, but if not, they could be replaced with something more current.
