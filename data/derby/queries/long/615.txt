Ensure that running derbyall tests all Derby's functionality works with a security manager and a correctly, minimally configured policy file. By minimally I mean just the fewset set of permissions required, hopefully in-line with the documentation. E.g. a policy file that allowed all permissions would work but would not be a good test of Derby.
