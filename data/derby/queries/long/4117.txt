This problem was discovered when testing 10.5.1.0-RC1. The dblook shell script fails if the database URL contains characters that have a special meaning to the shell, even if those characters are properly escaped/quoted on the command line. Example:

$ ./bin/dblook -d 'jdbc:derby:jar:(demo/databases/toursdb.jar)toursdb'
./bin/dblook[29]: eval: syntax error at line 1: `(' unexpected

Connection attributes, like create=true, will be ignored because the semi-colon makes the script execute the setting of the connection attribute as a separate shell command:

$ ./bin/dblook -d 'jdbc:derby:NewDatabase;create=true'                
– Timestamp: 2009-03-25 09:54:56.169
– Source database is: NewDatabase
– Connection URL is: jdbc:derby:NewDatabase
– appendLogs: false

– Note: At least one unexpected error/warning message was
– encountered during DDL generation.  See dblook.log
– to review the message(s).

In dblook.log:

java.sql.SQLException: Database 'NewDatabase' not found.
