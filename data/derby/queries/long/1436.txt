setEmbeddedCP.ksh (and setNetworkClient.ksh) gives the following message if neither DERBY_HOME nor DERBY_INSTALL is set:

  echo "\$DERBY_HOME or \$DERBY_INSTALL not set. Please set one of these variables"
  echo "to the location of your Derby installation."

but the scripts do not work if only DERBY_HOME is set
