There are still couple more tests that change the lock time out during the test run but don't restore it to the default at the
end of the test. Knut already fixed this behavior for SetTransactionIsolationTest.java and ResultSetMiscTest.java as part of DERBY-4273 
Following are some additional tests that should be fixed 
1)ErrorMessageTest.java 2)StressMultiTest.java 3)Sttest.java 4)SysinfoTest.java 5)DatabaseMetaDataTest.java 6)ResultSetsFromPreparedStatementTest.java
