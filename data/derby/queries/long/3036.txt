I ran across this issue while trying to write some upgrade tests from 10.3 codeline into main codeline(10.4). The upgrade code was not kicking in because the 10.4 codeline does not mark the data dictionary with 10.4 version. It is still at 10.3 version.

I will check in some changes soon to address this issue.
