Create JUnit tests for testing BLOBs.

This includes:

	BLOBDataModelSetup, which creates a table with BLOB columns, and populates it with BLOBs of size 1MB - 64 MB.
	TestInputStream: InputStream class which returns n bytes of dummy data
	BLOBTest: Junit TestCase for testing reading BLOBs using different ResultSet types, and updating them using positioned updates or with result set methods.
