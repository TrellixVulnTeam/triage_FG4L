Most functionality of and information about a running instance of the Network Server is currently only available from the host running the Network Server, using the NetworkServerControl API.

With a JMX Management and Monitoring service in place utilizing JMX (DERBY-1387), it is possible to expose some of the Network Server functionality and information through an MBean that is specific to the Network Server, to both local and remote users (JMX clients), subject to security restrictions. Access to Derby libraries on the client side is not even a requirement, potentially making a server administrator's job a lot easier.
