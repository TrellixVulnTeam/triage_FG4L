This applies to the following
setEmbeddedCP
setNetworkServerCP
setNetworkClientCP

Bug DERBY-4283 references this issue, but only with regard to the setEmbeddedCP script.  That bug also indicates the issue was resolved in 10.5.2, but I am looking at 10.5.3 and I still see the exit command in the script.

The proper way to use these CLASSPATH scripts is to source them rather than run them.
. $DERBY_HOME/bin/setNetworkServerCP

Doing so will run the script in the current shell.  If the scripts issue an exit upon encountering an error, then the users shell will exit as well.

This is the relevant section of the scripts
if [ -z "$DERBY_HOME" ] ; then
  echo "Error: DERBY_HOME is not set. Please set the DERBY_HOME environment variable"
  echo "to the location of your Derby installation."
  exit 1   #<<<<This will exit the users shell if the script is sourced
fi

The scripts should generate a message if DERBY_HOME is not set, but should not issue an exit command.
