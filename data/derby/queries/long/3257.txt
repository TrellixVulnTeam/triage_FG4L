Attached program demonstrates the problem.  Only one count is returned (matching CODE= GBR) - the count of CODE=CHA is not returned.  Works fine with versions 10.1 and 10.2 or if program is run using 10.3 jars and 10.2 database (soft upgrade).

Query:
SELECT COUNT(t0.ID) FROM CTS1.TEST_TABLE t0 
  GROUP BY t0.CODE 
    HAVING (t0.CODE = 'GBR' OR t0.CODE = 'CHA') AND t0.CODE IS NOT NULL
