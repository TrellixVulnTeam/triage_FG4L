Since the fix for DERBY-4437 (which was backported to the 10.8 branch for 10.8.2.0) the message 2200H has changed to take two parameters, schemaname.sequencename, but the foreign language files only mention 1 parameter, which would be the schemaname.

This issue would be fixed by changing the ''
{0}'' in the non-English locales to ''{0}
.
{1}
'' (note: retain the double single quotes).
