I was trying to verify that the changes in DERBY-920 hadn't
introduced any new compatibility problems (they shouldn't, because
we were changing an internal class, but I wanted to make sure).

So I was trying to follow some old tips about how to run tests with
an old client against a new server, as documented in:
http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/TestingOldClientNewServer

However, when I did this, the test "testProtocol" did not terminate.
