LIKE should throw an error  if it has mismatching params.  

Mamta gives the standard references:
The collation rule for c1 like c2 should be same as c1 = c2 as per SQL specification.

As per SQL spec, Section 8.5 <like predicate>, Syntax Rules 3d),
"The collation used for <like predicate> is determined by applying Subclause 9.13, "Collation determination", with operands CVE, PC, and (if specified) EC."

As per SQL spec, Section 8.2 <comparison predicate>, General Rules 3a),
"Let CS be the collation as determined by Subclause 9.13, "Collation determination", for the declared types of the two character strings."

Please let me know if you have any further questions in this area.
