There was this error during the 10.5.2.0 test run - when the ErrorMessageTest was run by itself later there was no problem, and neither did this show up during the ibm 1.6 run:

1) testDeadlockTimeout(org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.lang.ErrorMessageTest)junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: Not a deadlock expected:<...001> but was:<...XL2>
