Allowing compile.classpath to be set to jsr169compile.classpath is to ensure that the mainstream code that is build (using compile.classpath) does not depend on classes outside the currently supported J2ME/CDC/Foundation 1.1 level.

This was to avoid methods not in J2ME/CDC/Foundation 1.1 creeping into the code, as in DERBY-2109.

Fails currently in the shared code accessing JDBC XA and ParameterMetaData classes. Used to work.
