I have started converting compatibility/testScript.xml to JUnit to
1) be able to more dynamically specify which combinations to test, 
2) get standard JUnit reports from the test, and
3) more easily include the compatibility test in the regression test runs.


I plan to use a property file (patterened after the current ant.property file for 
the compatibility test), to specify jvm and derby library locations.


With the growing number of jvm and derby versions I also think that it should be 
possible to specify a number of different kinds of compatibility test combinations,
for example:

a) the current way, which is all combinations of derby and jvm on both 
   server and client.                                            [(derbys*jvms)*(derbys*jvms)]
b) Current trunk client and jvms  vs.  all server derbys and jvms. [(1*jvms)*(derbys*jvms)]
c) All clients and jvms  vs.  current trunk server and jvms.        [(derbys*jvms)*(1*jvms)]
d) Exact specification of the combinations to be tested.         [(N*M)*(X*Y)]

Which kind of test to run should be specified in the property file.
