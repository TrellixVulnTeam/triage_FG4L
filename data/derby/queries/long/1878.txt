Some network server tests (specially those that spawn new process) have bad error handling that results in the test hanging forever if it fails, thus holding up execution of a nightly test run.    The tests must timeout instead of hanging forever if it fails. 

Please see http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-1694#action_12435129  for some possible improvements.
