Building Derby in CruiseControl shows 66 Errors/Warnings, the majority of which are informational messages.

This messages should be tagged with the level="info" attribute in the <echo> task.

E.g. genParser target in the top-level build.xml should have

<echo level="info" message="  $
{msg}
"/>

Will add comment with the messages I think should be informational.
