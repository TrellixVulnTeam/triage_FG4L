The HTML report is a great beginning but it is lacking some information on the summary page. I think this info would be useful.

Date of the run
Version information for Derby
JVM version information

Ideally a brief summary at the top-level, maybe a separate page could have the full detail, such as sysinfo output.

Possible could be done using the style sheets rather than modifying the task, my xsl ability was limited to changing the
heading from "Unit Test" to "Apache Derby Testing" 

Was thinking the junit-init target could generate the correct data and the style sheet incorporate it.
