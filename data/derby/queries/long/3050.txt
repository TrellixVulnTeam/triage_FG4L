There are currently 3 sets of GROUP BY tests:

	GroupByExpressionTest.java
	GroupByTest.java
	groupBy.sql



The first two tests are JUnit tests; the groupBy.sql tests are old-style harness tests,
although they are now run in the JUnit framework using the LangScripts technique.

This sub-task proposes to convert the groupBy.sql tests to JUnit tests, and to include
them directly into GroupByTest.java.

The DERBY-2151 conversion tool can be used to assist in the conversion process.
