It is often very difficult to collect correct sysinfo output from user environments because  sysinfo run from the commandline does not have the same classpath as the jvm that started Derby or Derby was loaded with a custom classloader.

It would be very helpful in assisting users in diagnosing their issues if sysinfo dumped to the error log if  derby.stream.error.logSeverityLevel=0  or even by default.
