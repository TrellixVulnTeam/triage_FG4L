The UUIDFactory and UUID interfaces (and their implementations) contain some unused methods that could be removed:

UUIDFactory/BasicUUIDFactory: The method recreateUUID(byte[]) is not used, except in a unit test (T_UUIDFactory)

UUID/BasicUUID: The methods toByteArray() and toHexString() are never called, and the constructor BasicUUID(byte[]) is only called by the unused recreateUUID() factory method.
