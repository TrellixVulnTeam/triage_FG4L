jar -jar lib/derbyrun.jar server start

Network Server startup failed. User authentication should be enabled before the
Network Server installs a security manager. Please either set the 'derby.connect
ion.requireAuthentication' system property to true or run the network server wit
h the '-noSecurityManager' option.

1) Setting derby.connection.requireAuthentication to true is not sufficient to have a working system.

2) Use of "should" in "should be enabled", it's a requirement, so use "must"

3) Hopefully setting the derby properties in derby.properties also works so there is no requirement for the authentication to be defined using system properties.

 Maybe the wording could just state that authentication must be setup and somehow reference the appropriate properties?
