ERROR X0Y84: Too much contention on sequence SEQ. This is probably caused by an uncommitted scan of the SYS.SYSSEQUENCES catalog. Do not query this catalog directly. Instead, use the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_PEEK_AT_SEQUENCE function to view the current value of a query generator.

I think it is meant to say "sequence generator" instead of "query generator".
