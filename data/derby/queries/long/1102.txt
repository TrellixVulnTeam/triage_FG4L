Test uses the methods of  TriggerExecutionContext  to displat information about the tirgger. These are old non-standard and non-public interfaces from the old Cloudscape product. Tests should be re-written to not use such interfaces, only publshed interfaces which is all SQL for triggers.
Methods on TriggerExecutionContext  that are no longer required should be removed.
