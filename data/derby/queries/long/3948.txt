Thanks to Dag for finding this restriction in the SQL Standard, part 2, section 11.39, SR 12 c) I see this provision:

   12) If BEFORE is specified, then:
     :
     c) The <triggered action> shall not contain a <field reference> that
     references a field in the new transition variable corresponding to a
     generated column of T.
