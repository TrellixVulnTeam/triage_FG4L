Recently, final versions of the Derby logo contributed by Roger Dudler were uploaded to JIRA issue DERBY-914. These logos should be incorporated into the PDF and HTML Book (aka monohtml manuals) formats, where there is currently a placeholder that says 'Derby Logo'. If possible, the text 'Apache Derby' which is underneath 'Derby Logo' in these formats should either be replaced by the logo text submitted in DERBY-914 or made to fit on the same line as the logo.
