The developer community has approved the proposal to sunset support for Java 5 and CDC: http://apache-database.10148.n7.nabble.com/VOTE-Sunsetting-support-for-Java-5-and-CDC-td129832.html#a129925

This issue tracks a number of tasks needed to implement this proposal:

I) Remove build support for Java 5 and CDC.

II) Purge user doc references to Java 5, CDC, and the JDBC 4 DataSources.

III) Remove the JDBC 4 version of the public api from the published javadoc. The recently introduced CP2 DataSources would need to migrate to the JDBC 3 version of the published javadoc. The JDBC 4 versions of the DataSources would still exist, but they would be vacuous extensions of their JDBC 3 counterparts.

IV) On the wiki, document our expectation that maintenance releases will support the same platforms as the original feature release cut from their branch.

V) Decide what to do with the SimpleMobileApp. Probably we want to just remove this demo since its purpose is to show how to run Derby on the deprecated CDC platform.
