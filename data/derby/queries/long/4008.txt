As part of the change for DERBY-728 we will implement UNICODEMGR which will require ACCSEC be sent in EBCDIC.  After DERBY-4004 is fixed the client should send the RDBNAM on ACCSEC only if EBCDIC conversion is possible.  This will maintain compatibility with old servers for database names that can be converted but will allow us to defer sending the database name to SECCHK so that we can send the RDBNAM in UTF-8 with new servers when UNICODEMGR is active.
