The replication slave role includes many tasks:


	set up a network connection with the master
	receive chunks of log from the master, and parse these into individual log records
	append log records to the local log file
	make sure that the recovery process is not allowed to access the logfile we are currently writing to
	etc



This issue is for adding a controller that will start/stop/initiate all services needed for the replication slave role.
