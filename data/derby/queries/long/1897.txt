Running the jdbcapi/_Suite with the test harness with wctme5.7_foundation results in the following error:

0 add
> Failed to invoke suite():java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax.sql.PooledConnection
Test Failed.

This is the only information available.

This error is especially strange because wctme5.7_foundation should support javax.sql.PooledConnection (in contrast to wctme5.7, which is not JDBC3.0 complient).
