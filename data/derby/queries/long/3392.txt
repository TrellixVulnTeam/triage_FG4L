Oystein says

"If I do failover on a database where replication has not been started, I get the following:

ij version 10.4
ij> connect 'jdbc:derby:masterDB;user=oystein;password=pass';
ij> connect 'jdbc:derby:masterDB;user=oystein;password=pass;failover=true';
ERROR XRE21: Error occurred while performing failover for database 'masterDB', Failover attempt was aborted.

I think I should rather get an error that says that database is not being replicated. (I get that if I try to stop replication on a non-replicated database)."
