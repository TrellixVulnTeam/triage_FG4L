I've found that Derby will not build sane properly for me. I have isolated it to here:

  <target name="evaluate.sane">
    <condition property="generate.sane">
      <equals arg1="$
{sane}
" arg2="true"/>
    </condition>
  </target>

The scope of the generate.sane property is limited to this target (only tested in a Windows XP environment), ergo it will always be an insane build. Patch to follow shortly.
