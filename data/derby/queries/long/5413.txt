Cf this piece of code in main

catch (Exception e)
{
     //if there was an error, exit(1)
     if ((e.getMessage() == null) ||
         !e.getMessage().equals(NetworkServerControlImpl.UNEXPECTED_ERR) ||
         printErrors
     )
     {
         if (server != null)
             server.consoleExceptionPrint(e);
         else
             e.printStackTrace();  // default output stream is System.out
     }
     // else, we've already printed a trace, so just exit.
     System.exit(1);

The call "server.consoleExceptionPrint(e)" will actually not print anything unless the debug flag "NetworkServerControlImpl#debugOutput" has ben set to true which it isn't a priori. 

I think it should be replaced by a call to server.consoleExceptionPrintTrace(e), which will print unconditionally.
