With empty ant.properties and JDK 6 installed in /tmp/jdk as the only JDK on the system, PropertySetter complains that it's not able to set java16compile.classpath:

Since it is able to detect both that the version of the default JDK is 1.6.0_13 and where it is installed, setting java16compile.classpath should be trivial.

If the name of the JDK directory is changed from /tmp/jdk to /tmp/jdk1.6.0, Derby is built successfully.
