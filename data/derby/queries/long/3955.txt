One test that was contributed during the IBM contribution of derby code was not runnable at the time - lang/selectivity.sql.
This test is still there, and I think might have some valuable regression tests if it gets adapted to the current functionality in Derby.

Ideally too, it should get converted to junit, or at least be made to run through the langScripts junit suite.
