See trunk/java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbc4/TestPreparedStatement_app.properties which says:


	test fails trying to read blob content files



Other tests succesfully read files so it must be possible to enable this test under the security manager.
Maybe the files need to be marked as support files and copied into the extin/extout/extinout folders
to use the existing permissions in the test policy files.
