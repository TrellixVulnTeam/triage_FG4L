I know it's hard to measure what "too slow" is, but this is a common complaint and this affects overall perception of Derby.  This appears to be related to another common complaint that it takes too long to create tables.  I am marking this as Urgent because of the impact it has to Derby perception and the fact that the 10.2 release is going to get such wide distribution through the Sun JDK.
