It would be very helpful to write exceptions to the fail directory as they oiccur with JUnit tests.    
If tests hang we can still get the failure information and sometimes it is just more efficient to be able to see failures as they occur.  Kristian attached a patch to DERBY-2667 for this but it no longer applies to trunk (derby-2667-WriteExceptionsToFileAsTheyHappen.diff).
