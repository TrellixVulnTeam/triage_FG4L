This will make the build even more flexible. Probably involves the following changes:

1) Relaxing the requirement in PropertySetter that a Java 5 JDK must exist

2) Having PropertySetter look for a Java 6 JDK (and set java16compile.classpath accordingly) just as PropertySetter looks for a Java 5 JDK today

3) Changing the setCompilerProperties target in the master build script so that it

  a) requires that java15compile.classpath or java16compile.classpath is set (it's ok for both to be set)

  b) sets java15compile.classpath to $
{jdbc3stubs}
:$
{java16compile.classpath}
