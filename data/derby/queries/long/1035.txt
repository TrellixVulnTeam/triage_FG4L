With client, if the isolation level is set with an SQL Statement such as "SET CURRENT ISOLATION = RS"  the value of  Connection.getTransactionIsolation() will not be correct.

jdbcapi/checkDataSource has tests for sending SQL statements to change the isolation level:

e.g.
	s.executeUpdate("set current isolation = RS");
	printState("SQL to change isolation in local", cs1);
I will disable these tests and reference this bug number.


It is not really clear how to handle this without parsing the statement on the client side.
