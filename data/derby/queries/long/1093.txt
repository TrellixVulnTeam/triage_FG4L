JDBC 4.0 requires that the result set returned from getProcedures must contain a new column SPECIFIC_NAME"and that the result set must be ordered by
PROCEDURE_SCHEM, PROCEDURE_NAME and SPECIFIC_ NAME.

The SYSALIASES table already has a column called SPECIFICNAME, so it should only be necessary to modify the query in metadata.properties.
