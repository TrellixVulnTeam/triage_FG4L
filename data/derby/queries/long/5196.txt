The Derby web site describes the layout of the log control file, log.ctrl, here: http://db.apache.org/derby/papers/logformats.html#Format+of+Log+Control+File This description does not agree with the format actually produced by LogToFile.writeControlFile(). That format can be examined using the ControlFileReader tool attached to DERBY-5195. The description on the web site should be corrected.
