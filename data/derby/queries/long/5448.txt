New errors were seen while running NsTest against the 10.8.2 release candidates. These errors are recorded as DERBY-5430 and DERBY-5422. The first error is a deadlock which occurs when inserting into the main table of the test. The second error is a problem clearing the identity cache. These errors have caused people to lose confidence in the concurrency improvements introduced by DERBY-4437. We should back the DERBY-4437 changes out of the 10.8 branch and use the trunk to continue debugging the problems disclosed by NsTest.
