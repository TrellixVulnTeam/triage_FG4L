There are some files (consisting of creative works) without license headers in the repository. Some files are also using a different text for the Apache License header then the other files.
I plan to add the license header after having verified that the files were uploaded to Jira with the grant license to ASF bullet ticked.

The list of files I have identified so far, grouped based on the assumed action required.

— Add license header

java/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/planexporter/AccessDatabase.java
java/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/planexporter/CreateHTMLFile.java
java/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/planexporter/CreateXMLFile.java

— Update license header
java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/jmxnone/NoManagementService.java
java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/jmx/JMXManagementService.java
java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/jmx/ManagementService.java

— Consider adding header
java/shared/org/apache/derby/shared/common/sanity/SanityState.java
java/shared/org/apache/derby/shared/common/sanity/SanityState.tmpl

java/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/planexporter/resources/advancedViewXSL.xsl
java/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/planexporter/resources/vanilla_html.xsl
java/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/planexporter/resources/advancedViewXSL2.xsl

The SanityState classes seem to come from somewhere. Does anyone have the history? Can we add the ASF license header?
The xsl files also look like creative works to me. Any objections on that?
