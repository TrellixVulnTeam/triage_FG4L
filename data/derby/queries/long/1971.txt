Several JUnit tools make use of TestSuite.getName() to display test hierarchies and other information. An example is junit.swingui.TestRunner.
Currently, the TestSuite objects generated by TestConfiguration are not given names.
To improve readability and the level of information, descriptive named should be set. At a minimum, the associated framework should be indicated. Another point is whether the user set name (if any) of the "root test suite" should be propagated or not.
