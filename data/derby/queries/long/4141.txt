When an XAException occurs during xa.start() or other XA operation, because of an SQLException, we have an errorCode of 0, regardless of the severity.  I would suggest XAER_RMFAIL for SESSION_SEVERITY or greater and XAER_RMERR for lower severity exceptions. See thread http://www.nabble.com/XAException.errorCode-on-XAException-caused-by-an-SQLException-tt22832423.html  for more detail and a reproduction.
