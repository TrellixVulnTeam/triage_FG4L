Derby 10.2 runs on the phoneME small device platform. However, on that platform Derby 10.3 fails to boot databases, complaining that Derby cannot find an appropriate implementation of DataValueFactory.

For details on how to install and run the phoneME platform, please see http://blogs.sun.com/wittyman/entry/javadb_on_sun_javame_cdc These are great instructions but I needed to adjust them as follows:

1) I had to use 10.2 because 10.3 and the development mainline would not run on this platform

2) I needed to to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that the vm could find the necessary shared libraries.

Here is the phoneME startup script which worked for me:

#! /bin/bash
#

	Run an ij script in the phoneME vm
#
	$1 is the script to run



export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CDC_HOME/lib

cd ~/demo/tearoffToPhone/data

$CDC_HOME/bin/cvm -Xbootclasspath/a:$JSR169_HOME/lib/jsr169.jar \
  -cp $DERBYJARS/derby.jar:$DERBYJARS/derbytools.jar \
  -Dij.dataSource=org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedSimpleDataSource \
  -Dij.dataSource.databaseName=sample  \
  -Dij.dataSource.createDatabase=create \
