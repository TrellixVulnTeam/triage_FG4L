There are some minor typos and issues in the English error messages files:

engine messages:

	42X52 - message has this:
    ' '
{0}
" (single quote - single quote - curly brace open - zero - curly brace close - double quote)
  should be two closing single quotes.
	XJ100.S has a stray double quote at the end
	XBCXU and XBCXV will get a double period in 'real live', for instance:
   ERROR XBCXU: Encryption of an un-encrypted database failed: Container was opened in read-only mode.   .
   ERROR XBCXU: Encryption of an un-encrypted database with a new key or a new password failed: Container was opened in read-only mode.   .
        Either the period/full stop at the end of the parameter string, or at the end of the 'parent' string will need to be removed.



And this is what my spell/grammar checker complained about:

	42X46, 42X47 has a grammar issue: "Use a the full signature" should be "Use the full signature"
	42X69: 'expresssion' has 3 s-es.
	58009.C.21, 7, 8 - DRDA codes should probably be in uppercase.
	XBM08.D - 'instantiage' should be 'instantiate'
	XSCB4.S - 'ie.' should be 'i.e.'
	XSDF2.S - 'exeception' should be 'exception'
	XSLAL.D - 'encounted' should be 'encountered'
	XSTB6.M - 'substitue' should be 'substitute'
	42Z54.U - 'excepiton' should be 'exception'
	C001 - 'A unknown' should be 'An unknown'
	L008, L009 - 'Deleteing' should be 'Deleting'



servlet_en.messages:
SRV_MaxTrys - 'trys' should be 'tries'
