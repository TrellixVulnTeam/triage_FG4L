Cf these lines:

assert(driverLevelString.indexOf('?') == -1);
assert(driverLevelString.matches("^JRE - JDBC: " + JDBCVersion + ".*"));

The "assert" is a Java built-in rather than the JUnit assertTrue we need.

The string driverLevelString is also wrong, since it is a mere toString of the bean name. We need to use getAttribute on it to get the driver level
for asserting.
