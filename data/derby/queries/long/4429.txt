Allow StressMultiTest to read System Property "derby.tests.ThreadsMinutes" to set the number of threads and minutes testStressMulti should run.
Example: '-Dderby.tests.ThreadsMinutes=33x3'.
This will set 
StressMultiTest.THREADS to 33 and
StressMultiTest.MINUTES to 3.

This can be utilized to for example
reduce the time StressMultiTest is run in a tinderbox test: '-Dderby.tests.ThreadsMinutes=33x3' and
increase the load for a specific test: '-Dderby.tests.ThreadsMinutes=200x60'.
The StressMultiTest defaults are as set with '-Dderby.tests.ThreadsMinutes=10x10'.

By default the test suite for StressMultiTest is set to  run in embedded, client and encryption mode, i.e. 3 x the Minutes specified.
