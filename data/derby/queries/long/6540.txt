ERROR 42X04: Column 'X' is either not in any table in the FROM list or appears within a join specification and is outside the scope of the join specification or appears in a HAVING clause and is not in the GROUP BY list. If this is a CREATE or ALTER TABLE  statement then 'X' is not a column in the target table.

The error message here is wrong. Column X does exist in APP.NEW, so the CREATE TRIGGER statement should have succeeded.
