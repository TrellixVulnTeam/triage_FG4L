On a database with territory=no_NO and collation=TERRITORY_BASED, I get these results from a query which uses the LIKE predicate:

ij> select * from t where x like '%a%';
X

a                   
-a                  
 a                  
B                   
C                   

12 rows selected

The last two rows ('B' and 'C') should not have been included in the result, since they do not match the pattern '%a%'.

Similar wrong results are seen with '%aa%':

ij> select * from t where x like '%aa%';
X
