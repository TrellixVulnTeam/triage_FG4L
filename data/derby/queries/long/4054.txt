If I do a multithreaded clob update which gets an exclusive table lock on the table, space will not be reclaimed.  This case is similar to DERBY-4050 except that the test gets an exclusive table lock and the growth happens whether or not the update is synchronized.  I will add a disabled test for this to ClobReclamationTest and reference this bug.
