> FAIL – derby.system.durability=test mode seems to be broken.
> – In this mode one would expect that inserts with autocommit off and on would be in the same range as syncs are not happening but the difference here seems to be more than the approximate estimated range.
> – Also comparing the time taken to do the inserts without this property set seems to be in the same range as with this property set.
> – Please note this test times inserts and approximate estimates were considered to report this observation.
Test Failed.
