The file SimpleNetworkClientSample.java under the demo/nserverdemo has an error which prevents
it from completing successfully.

The one line that is a problem is this:

        private static final String DERBY_CLIENT_URL= "jdbc:derby://localhost:
"+ NETWORKSERVER_PORT+"/NSSampledb;create=true";

The one line fix is this:

        private static final String DERBY_CLIENT_URL= "jdbc:derby://localhost:"+
 NETWORKSERVER_PORT+"/" DBNAME";create=true";
