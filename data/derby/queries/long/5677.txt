There is some logic in the test harness to allow test runs without derbynet.jar on the classpath (to test the embedded engine only). When I tried this on head of trunk, it failed with java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl when setting up the test suites, so no tests started.
