Derby is supposed to have an incremental build. That is, if you change a file, then the following command should recompile the file:

   ant all

There are several places in the graph of Derby build targets where this is not true. If you change a file in certain packages, a subsequent "ant all" won't notice the change. This issue is a place where we can track these bugs.
