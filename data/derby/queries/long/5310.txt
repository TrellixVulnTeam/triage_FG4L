Building with JDK 7 works fine, but the following warning is printed:

[setJdkProperties] Unrecognized VM vendor: 'Oracle Corporation'
[setJdkProperties] An attempt to configure the required JDKs will be made, but the build may fail.
[setJdkProperties] In case of problems:
[setJdkProperties]   - consult BUILDING.html and set the required properties manually
[setJdkProperties]   - set the property printCompilerProperties to true and ask the Derby development community for help
[setJdkProperties]     (please provide the debug output from running ant)

We should update PropertySetter to silently accept the JDK if the vendor is Oracle.
