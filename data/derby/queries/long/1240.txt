creating/restoring  a database from a backup copy with exteral log location  copies the transaction log to the default location.  db uses the external location , but there is unnessary copy of transaction log at default location. 


connect 'wombat;create=true';
create table t1(a int );
insert into t1 values(15);
call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE('extinout/mybackup');
connect 'wombat;shutdown=true';
disconnect;

— create a db from the backup using a different log location.
connect 'crwombat;createFrom=extinout/mybackup/wombat;logDevice=extinout/crwombatlog';
select * from t1;

— If you loook under the "crwombat" dir  you will find the log dir , it should not  be there because 
–  transaction log  is place st  extinout/crwombatlog  as specified in the  connection URL.
