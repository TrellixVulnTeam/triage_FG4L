Currently, derbyclient.jar is built from a hardcoded list of classes in the top-level build.xml file. This causes a few unnecessary and unwanted classfiles to be added to the insane jar files, such as SanityManager and some of the reference files. derbyclient.jar should be built from a dependency list generated by classlister, similar to how the other jars are built.
