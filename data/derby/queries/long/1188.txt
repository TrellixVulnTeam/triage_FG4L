Currently the truncate defragment pass holds locks until it commits.  It would be better if it committed more often.  To do this
the loop must be enhanced to pick up ddl level state change when the commits happen and release locks.  It may be that
work being done in 10.2 for scrollable updatable result sets across commits in open cursors will help with this.
