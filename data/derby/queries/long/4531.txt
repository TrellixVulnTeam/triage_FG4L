The javadoc for PreparedStatement.setCharacterStream does not specify that the stream passed in will be closed, only that it will read to the number of characters specified.
For the embedded driver, the stream is not closed after execution; the client driver, however, will close the stream when the internal stream object EncodedInputStream is garbage collected, which can happen any time after the statement has been executed.
I am not sure this a bug vs. the JDBC specification, but it would be nice to harmonize client and embedded behavior on this.
