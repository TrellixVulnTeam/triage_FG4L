The ant target genrelnotes (from tools/release/build.xml) should use JQL querying mode by default, such that you don't have to specify jira.filter.id when invoking it.

It will still be possible to specify jira.filter.id to instruct the tool to use an existing JIRA filter if that is required for some reason.
