The current javadoc, (which is not to be published, see DERBY-138) is incorrect for the class org.apache.derby.diag.ErrorMessages:

Instead of this:
-----------
ErrorMessage is a VTI that shows all the SQLStates, locale-sensitive error messages, and exception severities for a database. 

To use it, query it as an external virtual table:

 SELECT* FROM NEW ErrorMessages() AS EQ; 
-----------
I'd suggest this:
-----------
ErrorMessage shows all the SQLStates, locale-sensitive error messages, and exception severities for a database. 

To use it, query it as follows

 SELECT * FROM NEW org.apache.derby.diag.ErrorMessages() AS EQ; 
-----------
