In converting LobLimits.java DERBY-1903 and trying to enable LobLimitsLiteTest with client. I discovered that this  case fails with client:
       try 
{
            insertClob2("ClobTest #9.1 ", conn, insertClob2,
                    MORE_DATA_THAN_COL_WIDTH, 4, 1,
                       MORE_DATA_THAN_COL_WIDTH, CHARDATAFILE);
            fail("ClobTest #9.1 " + "should have thrown XSDA4"); 
        }
 catch (SQLException sqle) 
{
            assertSQLState("XSDA4", sqle);
        }
        // no row must be retrieved.
        selectClob2("ClobTest #9.2 ", conn, selectClob2, BIG_LOB_SZ, 4, 0,
                   CHARDATAFILE);

If I omit the fail assertion, the row actually does get inserted and has presumably been truncated.
I will check in LobLimits.java soon with this bug number in the comments.
To reproduce, remove the if(!usingDerbyNetClient) condition and run the test largedata.LobLimitsLiteTest to reproduce the problem.
