Data source implementations ClientDataSource, ClientConnectionPoolDataSource and ClientXADataSource all lose the value of the property connectionAttributes when they are converted into a Reference object using getReference and back to a data source.
Due to missing field propertyKey_connectionAttributes in ClientBaseDataSource, which drives the Reference process.

Have new test that tests the Reference interface, jdbcapi/dataSourceReference.java
