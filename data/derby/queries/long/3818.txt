In the test memory.MultiByteClobTest that was added for DERBY-3741, the client version of the test took 525000ms vs 9578ms for embedded, so I disabled the client test for now.  The client test should be analyzed to determine why Clob handling is so slow.   I am not sure if the problem is on the insert, the retrieval or both.  Once this issue is resolved it would be good to enable the test for client.
