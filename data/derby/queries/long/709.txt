ERROR 38000: The exception 'java.security.AccessControlException: access denied
(java.util.PropertyPermission user.dir read)' was thrown while evaluating an exp
ression)

Can be seen in the store/encryptionKey.sql test, modify the _app.properties file to enable the security manager.

Due to logging messages using File.getCanonicalPath in RawStore.java, lines 675 and 686.

Possible solutions:

	use a privileged block and required user.dir permission granted to user.dir to backup to a relative directory
	use a privileged block,if a security exception is thrown then just display the relative name, otherwise display the full name. This would allow backups to succeed without requiring granting additional permissions to derby.jar
	just log the relative path
