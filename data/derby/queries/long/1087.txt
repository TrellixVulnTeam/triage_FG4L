Running the following code with different queries in the first statement produces different results.
Where t1 has two columns: "a" of type int is the primary key, and "b" of type varchar(50); and contains 10 rows of data.


            Statement st1 = conn.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, 
                    ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);
            Statement st2 = conn.createStatement();

            ResultSet rs = st1.executeQuery("SELECT a, b FROM t1");
            rs.next();
            rs.next();
            st2.executeUpdate("UPDATE t1 SET a = a + 20 WHERE a = " + 
                    rs.getInt(1));
            try 
{
                rs.updateInt(1, rs.getInt(1) + 30);
                rs.updateRow();
            }
 catch (SQLException se) 
{
                System.out.println(se.getMessage());
            }
            rs.close();

            rs = st2.executeQuery("SELECT a FROM t1");
            while(rs.next()) 
{
                System.out.println("A = " + rs.getInt(1));
            }
            rs.close();

            st2.close();
            st1.close();

If the first query is "select a, b from t1", the output will be:
A = 1
A = 3
A = 4
A = 5
A = 6
A = 7
A = 8
A = 9
A = 10
A = 32

If the first query is "SELECT a, b FROM t1 WHERE a <= 5", the output will be:
Cursor 'SQLCUR0' is not on a row.
A = 1
A = 3
A = 4
A = 5
A = 6
A = 7
A = 8
A = 9
A = 10
A = 22

If the first query is "SELECT a FROM t1", the output will be:
Cursor 'SQLCUR0' is not on a row.
A = 1
A = 3
A = 4
A = 5
A = 6
A = 7
A = 8
A = 9
A = 10
A = 22
