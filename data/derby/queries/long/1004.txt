For a PooledConnection.getConnection() the connection gets closed.
 Embedded automatically rolls back any activity on the connection.
 Client requires the user to rollback and gives an SQLException  
 java.sql.Connection.close() requested while a transaction is in progress

The test jdbcapi/checkDataSource.java shows this bug.   A boolean needRoolbackBeforePCGetConnection has been added to the test and  explicit rollback has been added to the test to get it to run with client.

To reproduce take out instances of the explicit rollback for client from the test e.g.

if (needRollbackBeforePCGetConnection)
			c1.rollback();
