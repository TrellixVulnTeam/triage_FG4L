If network server is started  and shutdown from the comand line t does not shutdown the database.   This can is evidenced by the fact that the db.lck file remains after  the following steps.


java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start &

<some database access>

java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl shutdown
 There is much discussion about the correct behavior of NetworkServer in this regard related to embedded server scenarios in DERBY-51, but it seems clear in this  case the databases should be shutdown.
