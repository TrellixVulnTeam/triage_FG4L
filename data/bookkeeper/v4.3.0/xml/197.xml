                <project id="12311293" key="BOOKKEEPER">Bookkeeper</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In the current implementation of HedwigConsole.java, The same server-cfg file (default = hedwig-server/conf/hw_server.conf) is used to load both hubServerConf and bkClientConf. This seems incorrect because both have different option names. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="13242010" author="hustlmsp" created="Fri, 30 Mar 2012 03:28:39 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;hmm, actually hub server is a bookkeeper client. when hub server runs, it would load server cfg file as ServerConfiguration for hub server, and as ClientConfiguration for bookkeeper client. since hedwig console is an admin tool for a hub server, it works as what hub server does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the problem here is hub server uses a flat key/value configuration file, it lacks the ability to group properties into sections (said hub server settings in hub server section, bookkeeper client settings to bookeeper section) to avoid option name confliction. (although option name confliction would not happen now, since bookkeeper uses camel word for option name, while hedwig doesn&apos;t)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13242646" author="i0exception" created="Fri, 30 Mar 2012 19:49:49 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;What would be a good resolution for this? Currently, by just merging the two files into one, I am able to get the desired behavior. But it feels more like a hack than a solution. My use-case is connecting to a hedwig server where zookeeper is running on a remote machine. The current setup doesn&apos;t pick up the zookeeper location. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that could be done is have a separate configuration file (HEDWIG_CONSOLE_CONF perhaps) altogether and pass that as an option in the shell script bin/hedwig. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13243044" author="hustlmsp" created="Sat, 31 Mar 2012 06:54:52 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; My use-case is connecting to a hedwig server where zookeeper is running on a remote machine. The current setup doesn&apos;t pick up the zookeeper location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the bookkeeper settings are missed in default hedwig server configuration file. so the bookkeeper client could not pick up the right zookeeper location. I would try to add them in the default hedwig server configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Another thing that could be done is have a separate configuration file (HEDWIG_CONSOLE_CONF perhaps) altogether and pass that as an option in the shell script bin/hedwig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is a good point. how about changing HedwigConsole to use HEDWIG_CONSOLE_CONF variable (by default it points to hedwig server conf)? doing it in this way, ur are flexible to override the variable to point either file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to add a patch about how changing it. You can take a look at it, whether it meets your requirements &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13243053" author="hustlmsp" created="Sat, 31 Mar 2012 07:37:52 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Hedwig console uses a HedwigAdmin and a HedwigClient. HedwigAdmin is used to manage metadata, so it would read hub server configuration to known settings such as zkServers, ledgerManagerType used by bookkeeper. HedwigClient is used to play with hedwig system, such as pub/sub/consume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so it would read 2 configuration files, one is &apos;-server-cfg&apos; which is used by HedwigAdmin, the other one is &apos;-client-cfg&apos; which is used by HedwigClient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, the console is shipped with a hub server package. so it would use hub server configuration for metadata manager, no client configuration need since it just use default client configuration to connect to local hub server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attach a patch to expose these two files by two environment variables, one is &apos;HEDWIG_CONSOLE_SERVER_CONF&apos;, the other is &apos;HEDWIG_CONSOLE_CLIENT_CONF&apos;. If user tries to install the console in an admin node (not a hub server node), he/she could override these two variables to reference a customized configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; My use-case is connecting to a hedwig server where zookeeper is running on a remote machine. The current setup doesn&apos;t pick up the zookeeper location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the bookkeeper settings are missed in default hedwig server configuration file. so the bookkeeper client could not pick up the right zookeeper location. I would try to add them in the default hedwig server configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my previous comment is not right. did some comparison between hedwig console and PubSubServer. I found that PubSubServer uses zookeeper server setting in hub server, while HedwigAdmin uses zookeeper server setting from bookkeeper. so you couldn&apos;t locate zookeeper when zookeeper is remote and you didn&apos;t put bookkeeper server setting in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I add a change in HedwigAdmin to let it use setting from hub server configuration, which matches what hub server does.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I also don&apos;t have it clear if this assignment still makes sense &quot;this.bkClientConf = bkConf;&quot;. I haven&apos;t checked trunk, so the comment about the assignment could be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13249757" author="hustlmsp" created="Mon, 9 Apr 2012 10:42:14 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;yeah, the log statement is not correct. fix it in the new patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the assignment of bkClientConf is OK, since the zookeeper instance has been instantiated using hub server configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Aniruddha, could you have a look at this patch to see whether is it OK for you?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
