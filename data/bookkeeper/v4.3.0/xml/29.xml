                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The failure doesn&apos;t hit every time. You have to run, multiple times. From bookkeeper-server, run mvn test -Dtest=BookieRecoveryTest multiple times to repro.&lt;br/&gt;
Test output is attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this should repro it.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

The tests created a bunch of bookies, and wrote a load of entries and failed the server. They then created a new server and tried to verify the recovered ledger. The problem was that there was no time between creating the server and trying to verify, which meant that the watcher on the client may not have been updated with the full bookie list. This meant that a full ensemble could not be built and the test failed at that point. This patch fixes that by moving the creation of the new server to earlier in the test, before the entries are written but after the initial ledger handle is created.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It doesn&apos;t look like moving the start of a new bookie up solves completely the problem, since we are still not sure that the bookie has registered. It is true that we are giving more time, but in my understanding we are just reducing the chance that it happens and not eliminating it. We probably need to watch the list of bookies on ZooKeeper to be able to determine when the list changes;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There is a change to the log4j.properties that shouldn&apos;t be there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Usually a cluster will be have all machines started before the failure even happens. The only reason the recovery server is started later in this case is so that it doesn&apos;t become part of the original ensemble. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think just putting the start server earlier is enough, because there are many calls to bk after this. This mean the test thread will be preempted and the zk watcher thread will get a chance to run, updating the available server lists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other option may be to do zk sync explicitly after the newServer call. I don&apos;t think it add anything though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. this is a mistake, i generated the patch wrong. reattached a new one. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

One of the reasons why we get bookies available through zookeeper is exactly to have the ability to remove and add servers dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for how to fix it, I was thinking that we could set a watch on the bookies znode before starting the bookie, and blocking until we get the notification. How does it sound to you? &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Well, I don&apos;t exactly expect them to exist from time zero as such. But I would expect them to exist before the failure. A scenario where you add a bookie after a failure and expect the recovery to be seamless seems unrealistic to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
As for how to fix it, I was thinking that we could set a watch on the bookies znode before starting the bookie, and blocking until we get the notification. How does it sound to you? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There already exists a watch on the bookie znodes, the bookie watcher on the client. I dont know how to wait on the notification without making the bookie watcher public. However, the zk.sync() i mentioned in my previous comment could be functionally equivalent, no?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13079091" author="ikelly" created="Wed, 3 Aug 2011 23:38:37 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Sync solution doesn&apos;t work. I added &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; CountDownLatch latch = &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; CountDownLatch(1);
        bkc.getZkHandle().sync(&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; VoidCallback() {
                &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; void processResult(&lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; rc, &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; path, &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; ctx) {
                    latch.countDown();
                }
            }, &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;);
        latch.await();

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to #startNewBookie (I left the calls to this method in their original places). It doesn&apos;t ensure the watcher is run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im trying with simply Thread.yield() to see if that does any better.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I&apos;ve attached a patch which reaches explicitly into the bookiewatcher now. Its a bit hacky, but it will guarantee that the available bookie list is updated.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

In each test, we set a watch on /ledgers/available to see when the new bookie is added. To make sure that we get the right change, we have to also wait until the crashed bookie is removed.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="13083019" author="fpj" created="Thu, 11 Aug 2011 09:57:32 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;This test still fails for me intermittently, but I think I have been able to nail it down. The main problem seems to be with BookieWatcher. To obtain a new bookie for an open ledger, we request it from BookieWatcher. It is possible, though, that we see a new bookie registered with ZooKeeper (as in stateNewBookie), but the notification of the change in ZooKeeper has not been processed by BookieWatcher yet. In this case, we close the ledger because we can&apos;t get a new bookie, and the test fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, we need to force an update to the list of the BookieWatcher object.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13083024" author="fpj" created="Thu, 11 Aug 2011 10:09:55 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;This patch does a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It adds a call to BookKeeper to enable updates to the list of a BookieWatcher object from a test;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It makes sure that the change in the list of bookies is the one we expect by checking continuously if the corresponding znode exists. This change actually simplifies the code of the test;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It also moves the call to instantiateZookeeperClient in the constructor of Bookie to after the initialization of the Bookie. This way we make sure that the bookie is ready to answer once it has registered with zookeeper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Removed redundant calls to new BookKeeper in Bookie. Its already done by the base class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Added synchronization on PerChannelBookieClient#connect&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I ran this patch in a loop for 3 hours at while point it hit the netty cleanup hang. 2. &amp;amp; 3. should help with this, though it&apos;s hard to find the root cause as a repro takes 3 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
