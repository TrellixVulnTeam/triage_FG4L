MimeTypeUtils.getMimeType() returns the default mime type for .odt (Open Office) files.

Because of this, it is not possible to parse OpenOffice files at this time.  I did some brief research, and could not find a mime type for Open Office files.  There was a comment that the mime type associated with these files is application/zip, since Open Office document files are zipped files.  That, of course, will not help us, since it would not be reasonable for us to assume that all zip files have Open Office content.

It is possible that there is now a mime type for Open Office documents, and I just could not find it.  (I hope so.)
