Although we may be rethinking our configuration options over the longer term, it would be helpful in the short term to rename config.xml to tika-config.xml, or some other name that would not be as general as config.xml.

The tika jar file will usually be one of many jar files included in an application, and its current location in the default package means that a different config.xml file might be found in the classpath before the Tika one.
