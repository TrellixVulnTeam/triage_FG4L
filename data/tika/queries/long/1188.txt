It would be good for Tika to support the Microsoft Project file format. Unfortunately, the only Java library for MPP is under the LGPL, so can't be used directly from within Tika.

This issue is to track changes needed to Tika itself, in order to be able to support a Third Party Plugin for Microsoft Project files, based on the LGPL licensed MPXJ

Note - details of the external plugin are available on the wiki, in http://wiki.apache.org/tika/3rd%20party%20parser%20plugins
