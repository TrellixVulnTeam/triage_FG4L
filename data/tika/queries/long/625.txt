The DcXMLParser class uses our streaming XPath mechanism to locate Dublin Core elements from a stream of SAX events. While powerful, that mechanism is a bit cumbersome to use for simple use cases where you'd just want to map the contents of a specific XML element or attribute into a metadata field. To make this simpler (and to remove the XPath processing overhead), I'd like to add new Attribute- and ElementMetadataHandler utility classes that focus on this specific use case.
