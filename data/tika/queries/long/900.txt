I have been testing Tika's ability to identify ISO9660 disk image file systems, and discovered two problems. Firstly, the offset match matcher was wrong (37633 instead of 32769). Secondly, and more seriously, it was impossible for that signaure to ever match, because the default buffer size was far too small. It is currently set to 8KB, and as this signature is some 36KB into the file, Tika could never find the match. The attached patch fixes the magic, and extends the buffer to 64KB.
