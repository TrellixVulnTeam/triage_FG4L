This patch will contribute a MimeType detection system for Tika, including MImeType data structure, and associated content-detection facilities. This will be based on Nutch's MimeType system as a baseline, however, I'm open to suggestions. Jerome Charron mentioned that he had an implementation of a MimeType system based on FreeDesktop.org's system. We should look into this as well.
