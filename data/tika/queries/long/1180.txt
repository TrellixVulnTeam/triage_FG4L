Following the work on TIKA-1177, we now have mimetype entries for the various formats which are based on the Matroska container (mkv, mka, webm etc). However, we are unable to properly identify the specific type just from some mime magic

Instead, for fully accurate detection, we'll need a new Detector for the Matroska family, which does some very simple container/stream processing to work out what the container contains
