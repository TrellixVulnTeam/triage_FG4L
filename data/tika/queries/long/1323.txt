I'd like to use tika-server for TIKA-1302.  As part of that, I'd like to record exception stacktraces per document.  I see two options: transmit the info back to the client (assuming a doc didn't bring the server down  ) along with the current error code or log the document id and stacktrace via the server.  Given my current design thoughts, I'd prefer the first option.

Any objections or recommendations?
