The current RTF parser doesn't process \bin control words yet. These control words are followed by a specific amount of binary data. Because of this, the RTF parser trips over some of these bytes in a number of (classified) documents.

I've implemented processing of the \bin control word, but it required of the core parsing algorithm. IMHO, it also improved readability of the code. I hope you will accept this patch. Please let me know if the patch requires modifications.

Apart from the \bin code word, this patch also makes the parser stop after reading the document-closing '}' character. In a number of files (again, classified), the parser would include non-readable characters that appeared after this closing brace.
