MetadataEP ("/metadata") has three capabilities:

1) JSON view of metadata
2) String value for a user requested metadata field
3) A reduced metadata object that only includes the values of a user-requested field

Given that don't seem to have loaded MetadataEP into tika-server cli, I don't think that functionality worked.  I could be very wrong, though, about its use!  Please let me know.

MetadataResource ("/meta") now handles 1), and I propose folding 2) and 3) into MetadataResource and deleting MetadataEP.
