There is a very large corpus of email addresses available: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/.

In processing even a subset of this corpus, I see numerous 'unexpected RuntimeException' errors resulting from tagsoup throwing on truly awful html. It seems to me that being able to do something with this entire stack would make a good '1.0' criteria for tika's email parser.
