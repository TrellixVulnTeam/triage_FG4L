According to: http://www.pdfa.org/2011/08/pdfa-metadata-xmp-rdf-dublin-core, dc:title, dc:description and dc:rights should allow multiple values because of language alternatives.  Unless anyone objects in the next few days, I'll switch those to Property.toInternalTextBag() from Property.toInternalText().  I'll also modify PDFParser to extract dc:rights.
