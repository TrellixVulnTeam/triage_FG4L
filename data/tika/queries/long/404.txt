As reported by Elif T. Kus on tika-user@, the media type handling code in Tika is locale-dependant. The MediaType class uses the String.toLowerCase() to normalize media type names, which is a good idea in general since types are supposed to be case insensitive, but unfortunately the toLowerCase() method returns different results based on the default locale of the platform.
