In Tika 1.1 and 1.2, it was possible to add some values to the URL that get logged like this:

http://localhost:9998/tika/GUID/FILENAME

This was very useful for correlating between client and server in a distributed compute environment. In 1.5 and in the nighty builds (for 1.6), this feature no longer works. Not having this makes it very difficult to troubleshoot problems with document processing in a distributed environment. 

Please add back this feature so that operations and development teams can more easily figure out which tika instance is processing which document and what the result of the processing resulted in.
