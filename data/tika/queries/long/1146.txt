I am trying to use Tika to extract metadata from eml's created via Novell Groupwise. By this I ran into  a problem with the dedection of "message/rfc822". The MagicDetector (working with the default tika-mimetypes.xml) compares the "match" values binary. RFC822 describes the header attributes are case independent (see http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0822.txt 3.4.7). So MIME-Version is the same than Mime-Version.
