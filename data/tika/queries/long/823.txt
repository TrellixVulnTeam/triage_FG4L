I would like both MimeTypes and the POIFSContainerDetector to be able to detect files created with Star Office Draw, Impress, Writer and Calc.

I started working on this, but stumbled upon a POI issue, which I posted to poi-user.

Nick? Yegor? I know you're on the Tika list as well. Could you take a look? How to get the raw content of CompObj entry?
