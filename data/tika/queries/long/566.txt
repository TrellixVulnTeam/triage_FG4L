As reported by Grant on users@, the getMimeType() convenience methods in the MimeTypes class are not very up to date with the latest best practices in type detection.

We should fix those methods for existing clients. It would also be good to make such convenience methods better available on the Tika facade, as there the API won't be so closely tied to the way we organize our media type handling code.
