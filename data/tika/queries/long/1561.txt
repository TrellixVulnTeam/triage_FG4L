"The Directory Interchange Format (DIF) is metadata format used to create directory entries that describe scientific data
sets. A DIF holds a collection of fields, which detail specific information about the data."
 The .dif file respect proper xml format that describe the scientific data set, the schema xsd files can be found inside the .dif xml file.

The reason opening this ticket is tika parser for this dif file is being under consideration with development, the support to identify the type of xml file is needed.
Although dif file in this case seems to be an proper xml file which can be parsed by xmlparser, still it might need a specific process on some of the fields to be extracted and injected into the Solr System for analysis.
Then it is proposed that the following type 'text/dif+xml' is appended and used in the tika-mimetypes.xml to be able to support the specific xml type detection which extends the application/xml, so that some special process can be applied to this particular xml file.

<mime-type type="text/dif+xml">
   <root-XML localName="DIF"/>
   <root-XML localName="DIF" namespaceURI="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aboutus/xml/dif/"/>
   <glob pattern="*.dif"/>
   <sub-class-of type="application/xml"/>
</mime-type>


Expected MIME type: text/dif+xml
