Tika 1.3 is not able to get attachments from the attached PDF.
The trunk is able to get attachments from the PDF.  However, if that PDF is then embedded in another document, the docs embedded in the PDF are not extracted.

I'm not sure of a solution, but I found two things that might help with the diagnosis:
1) If you modify the code in PDFParser so that it doesn't wrap the handler in a BodyContentHandler, everything works (in trunk).
2) If you modify BodyContentHandler to use my toy SimpleBodyMatchingContentHandler, the problem is also solved.

The cause may be in the MatchingContentHandler.
