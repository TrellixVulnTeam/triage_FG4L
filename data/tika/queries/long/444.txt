On http://tika.apache.org/source-repository.html

the URLs for browsing or checking out the source repo are no longer correct - It seems that the repo has been moved to http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tika

so the text below from the docs is incorrect:

The following is a link to the online source repository.

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/tika/trunk

Anonymous access

The source can be checked out anonymously from SVN with this command:

$ svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/tika/trunk tika-site
