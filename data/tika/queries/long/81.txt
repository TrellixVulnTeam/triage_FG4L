Since the default configuration is very often sufficient, we need to provide a constructor for MimeUtils that does not require explicitly specifying a configuration filespec.  We can easily get the default configuration from TikaConfig.getDefaultConfig(), though that's inefficient and not a good long term solution.  A longer term solution might remove the distinction between MimeUtils and MimeTypes altogether.
