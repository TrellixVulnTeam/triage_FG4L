Currently the JPEG+TIFF metadata extractor reads embedded keywords but not comments. There are XMP/IPTC fields that map nicely to the metadata fields AUTHOR, TITLE and DESCRIPTION. This is related to TIKA-314 and the XMP discussion in TIKA-442.

The attached patch adds parsing of these fields as set in XMP applications such as Photoshop: Object Name (Title), Caption (Description) and By-Line (Author).
