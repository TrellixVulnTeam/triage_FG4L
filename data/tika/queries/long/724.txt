I have a PDF with simple text "Here is some formatted text", but when
I extract with Tika I get extra spaces inserted:


H e re  i s  so me  fo rma tte d  te x t



When I created the text in this PDF (I used the PDFpen tool on OS X),
I set the style of the text to "loosen" (ie, increase space slightly
between the letters), so I think Tika (PDFBox) is trying to "respect"
that whitespace, but it'd be nice to turn this off (if it won't mess
up other places where we DO want the whitespace).

When I copy/paste the text is copied correctly.
