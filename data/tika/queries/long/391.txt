I am doing some testing of Tika 0.6 and noticed some odd results for the testEXCEL.xls file included in the test suite. 

100 calls to the following code:

            is = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(filename));

            Metadata metadata = new Metadata();
            metadata.set(Metadata.RESOURCE_NAME_KEY, filename);

            String type = tika.detect(is, metadata);

Results in different matches as application/msword or application/vnd.ms-excel seemingly at random.
