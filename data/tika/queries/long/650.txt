I've written a content handler that prints out the xhtml tags for conversion from a word document with embedded images. For images, it does not generate the "alt" attribute for img tags, which causes validation to fail. alt is a required attribute in XHTML.

Here's a partial output from http://validator.w3.org/check:


Error Line 3, Column 1026: required attribute "alt" not specified

...meta><title> </title></head><body><p><img src="embedded:image63.jpg"></img></p>

The attribute given above is required for an element that you've used, but you have omitted it. For instance, in most HTML and XHTML document types the "type" attribute is required on the "script" element and the "alt" attribute is required for the "img" element.

Typical values for type are type="text/css" for <style> and type="text/javascript" for <script>.
