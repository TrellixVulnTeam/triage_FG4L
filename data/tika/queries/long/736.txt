If I edit the footer text on the master slide of an OpenOffice presentation, I see that text rendered on the slide, but it's not extracted by Tika.

Digging into the document, curiously the footer text is in the styles.xml, under office:master-styles -> style:master-page -> draw:frame -> draw:text-box -> text.  I think somehow we're not linking up each slide's master text elements to that slide, similar to TIKA-712.
