As described on legal-discsuss [1], to use the NetCDF lib in Tika, we need to update our NOTICE and LICENSE files per Henri Yandell's comments that mention:

<snip>
In terms of NOTICE.txt; I go with the following:


	If putting in your own source code, then add the 3rd party license
text to the end of your LICENSE file and put in the NOTICE:



"Copyright 1993-2010 University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Unidata
