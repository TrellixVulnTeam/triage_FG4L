Currently the XHTML doesn't contain links, although PDFBox parses them. I'm new to Tika and haven't done java for 6 years, but someone more experienced could probably do this in a few hours. 

The PDF2XHTML method loops through the annotations. 

See: 


136: for(Object o : page.getAnnotations()) {



 I found some code for dealing with links in annotations:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7174709/pdfbox-not-recognizing-a-link

It involves checking the class. 


if( annotation instanceof PDAnnotationLink ) {
                PDAnnotationLink link = (PDAnnotationLink)annotation;



I hope this helps someone.
