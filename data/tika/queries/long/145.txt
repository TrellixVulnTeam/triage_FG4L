The Tika source tree or a source release does not contain our dependencies, so the associated LICENSE and NOTICE files do not need to cover them.

However, the Maven build automatically includes the depencencies in the -standalone jar, which thus should contain LICENSE and NOTICE files that do cover the dependencies.
