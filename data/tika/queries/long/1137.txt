The problem appears in version 1.3 and in revision 1494353.  I
attached a one-line patch that fixes it.

In method "WontBeSerializedError.writeObject", the loop over
"e.getStackTrace()" should break immediately after "found" is set to
"true".  All the iterations after "found" is set to "true" do not
perform any useful work, at best they just set "found" again to
"true".

Method "embedInTempFile" in class "ExternalEmbedderTest" has a similar
loop (over "embeddedMetadata.getValues(metadataName)"), and this loop
breaks immediately after "foundExpectedValue" is set to "true", just
like in the proposed patch.
