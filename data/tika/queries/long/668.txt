Currently an XML parse error will cause an untagged SAXException to be thrown and then reported as a illegal (a SAXException not thrown by the given ContentHandler) by the CompositeParser class.

To better handle this, the XMLParser class should explicitly capture any such SAXExceptions and wrap them into TikaExceptions as described in the Parser.parse() contract.
