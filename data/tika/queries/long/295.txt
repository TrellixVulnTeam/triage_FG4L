Attached is a patch for a first-cut at a parser that handles mailbox (.mbox, application/mbox) files.


	The first email headers are used to fill in metadata. Subsequent email headers are tossed.
	Charset handling needs to be fixed up. It's unclear (not spec'd) whether emails individually use the charset as specified in their individual header, or the entire file should be re-encoded (and the encoding is sent in the response header, or auto-detected).
	Multi-part emails won't be handled properly, though it's unclear what should be done in that case (if anything).
