Currently I can use the JAX-RS server to detect the mediatype using the meta endpoint. The problem I have with this is that I need to send the entire document to get all metadata. 

To detect the mediatype, only a few bytes are often necessary and so I'd like to only send, say 8K or so, to the server and let it tell me the mediatype.

In order to accomplish this, it would be good to modify the /meta endpoint to address the individual fields that might be returned:

/meta/mediatype
/meta/author
/meta/lastModified

The parts currently following the path could be turned into a query parameter, which I think is more appropriate anyways (also easier to manipulate with tools like jquery).

If sufficient data is not available, I'd just return with a BAD_REQUEST.

If this would be of interest to TIKA, I think I could possibly implement this.
