The excel extractor consumes lots and lots of memory when given an excel file containing a lot of numeric cells. I tested using a simple sheet containing 254 columns and 5511 rows resulting in an 8MB big file, this blowed with an OOME when given 512MB.
The memory issue is caused by the java NumberFormat that is instantiated for every numeric cell. A solution would be to cache the NumberFormat instance in the TikaHSSFListener class. Since NumberFormat is not thread-safe, it might be necessary to pool it.
