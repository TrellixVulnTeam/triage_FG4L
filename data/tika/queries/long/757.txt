I'm opening a blanket issue to remind us all to address the TODOs in the sources for when we upgrade to the next POI.

I think this (a single blanket issue) is better than keeping separate issues open even though they are technically fixed?

For example, I've committed TIKA-753 (speedups for embedded office docs), yet it included some TODOs for further speedups possible once we upgrade POI.  Rather than keeping TIKA-753 (and others like it) open, I think we should resolve them and let this issue cover all the TODOs.
