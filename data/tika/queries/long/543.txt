The feeds parser (see TIKA-466) has a dependency on Rome 1.0, as added to the tika-parser pom.xml with revision 964885.

This does not exist in the Maven central repository (that's only versions up to 0.9).

It worked previously due to java.net's maven repo being in the pom.xml, which was there for boilerpipe.

That repository was removed (as part of TIKA-462), so now the build fails if you don't already have rome 1.0 in your local Maven repo.
