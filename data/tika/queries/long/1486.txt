I've started running some routine tests on format information held in a number of tools, including Tika. This uncovered a number of minor issues when working with the tika-mimetypes.xml file:


	Duplicate MIME type application/gzip-compressed for type application/gzip.
	Duplicate MIME type image/vnd.dwg for type image/vnd.dwg.
	Error when parsing XML: Namespace prefix tika on link is not defined, line 169, column 15
	Format application/dita+xml;format=task has itself as a supertype!
	Glob '^owl$' for entry application/rdf+xml does not appear to be a valid filename specification.
	Glob '^rdf$' for entry application/rdf+xml does not appear to be a valid filename specification.



With the last two, it's really a matter of consistency. The other full-filename globs do not use the ^ and $ start and end markers, but owl and rdf do.
