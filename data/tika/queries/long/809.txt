From issue Tika-410: the issue's attached test document, "test.doc", causes an IndexOutOfBoundsException when dropped into a latest build of the tika-app GUI.  The reason is that the org.apache.poi.hwpf.usermodel.Picture class's suggestFileExtension() method, used by Tika's WordExtractor class, can return an empty string.  The requestSave method of the ImageSavingParser inner class (of TikaGUI) is not written to handle the case of an image having no extension.
