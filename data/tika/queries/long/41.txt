The Tika and Mime config files occur in two places in the jar file.  This is because they are not stored in our src/test/resources directory tree in the same place that they need to be in the target/classes directory tree, and there is a copy directive in the POM file that copies the files to different directory.

For example, tika-config.xml is in src/main/resources, but needs to go to target/class/org/apache/tika.  Maven automatically copies the files in src/main/resources to the same location in target/classes, so tika-config.xml is copied to target/classes.  Then, the copy directive in the POM file copies the file to target/classes/org/apache/tika.  So the file is copied twice.

I recommend the following to fix this:


	Move tika-config.xml to src/main/resources/org/apache/tika.
	Move tika-mimetypes.xml to src/main/resources/org/apache/tika/mime.
	Remove the copy directives for the above two from the POM file.
