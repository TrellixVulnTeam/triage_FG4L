There are several parts of the word documents (.doc and .docx) that we don't currently extract, but which would be nice to have.

These include:

	Hyperlinks
	Images (img tag referencing the name of the embeded image)
	Headings (when the default heading styles are used)
	Style information (when a style other than Default or a body is used on a paragraph, markup the p tag with it)



I'm proposing to add support for these in the near future
