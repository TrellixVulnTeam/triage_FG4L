GRB type detection with magic bytes and extension probably needs to be supported Tika, the GRB parser is under development, so it may be good to have its magic bytes and extension matching detection.

However, GRB does not have standard mime type, the following extension and MAGIC matching settings in the tika-mimetypes.xml are proposed to used for GRB mime type idenfication.

<mime-type type="application/x-grib">
    <acronym>GRIB</acronym>
    <_comment>General Regularly-distributed Information in Binary form</_comment>
    <tika:link>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRIB</tika:link>
    <magic priority="50">
      <match value="GRIB" type="string" offset="0"/>
    </magic>
    <glob pattern="*.grb"/>
<glob pattern="*.grb1"/>
<glob pattern="*.grb2"/>


Any kind suggestion and advice will be welcomed and appreciated.
