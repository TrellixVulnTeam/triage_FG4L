This is somewhat confusing and frustrating. I successfully crawled Opentext using all of the above. then I recrawled and it aborted almost immediately.
It choked on images, so I excluded them for now. 
but now it's choking on txt files! 
sometimes I get this error
SEVERE: null:java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/mozilla/universalchardet/CharsetListener

and sometimes I get this one
SEVERE: null:java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/tika/parser/txt/UniversalEncodingListener
