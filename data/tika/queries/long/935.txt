A TikaException is thrown when trying to drop either of the two .ar files from the parsers' test-documents folder into Tika-GUI.  From looking at this: http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/software/cygwin/cygwin_v1.3.2/usr/share/magic.mime   the archive detection is not done correctly for these types of files in the PackageExtractor class, and a TarArchiveInputStream is chosen by default, incorrectly.
