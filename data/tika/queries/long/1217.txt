It would be useful if Tika natively provided Java-7 FileTypeDetector [1] implementations. Adding the corresponding META-INF/services/java.nio.file.spi.FileTypeDetector files would allow the use of Files.probeContentType [2] without any specific links to Tika for this functionality.

If you do not want to rely on Java-7 for the core, then this could be added as an extension module.
