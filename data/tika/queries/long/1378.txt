I introduced a bug in MicrosoftTranslator when I was checking for isAvailable in the #setClient and #setId methods that produces and NPE when both aren't set. The Translator still works when auto configured, just not when explicitly configured.

I'll add a patch and unit test. (thanks to Tyler Palsulich for the idea on the unit test).
