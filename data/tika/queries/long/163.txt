As Gnome/KDE do not represent transfer file lists as DataFlavor.javaFileListFlavor the GUI does not respond to drag and drop events, rendering it useless in these desktop environments. As they represent transfer file lists as a list of URIs in a String a workaround is to convert this to a list of files.

A patch will follow to implement this.
