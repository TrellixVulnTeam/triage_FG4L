The plan so far has been to clean up our public APIs by dropping all deprecated parts before we do the 1.0 release.

The best way to do this will probably be to create a 0.x branch (and possibly prepare for a 0.10 release from it) right before going through the codebase and removing all deprecated parts. This should ideally be the last thing we do before releasing Tika 1.0.
