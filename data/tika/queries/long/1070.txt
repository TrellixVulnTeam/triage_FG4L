The error occurs when parsing big "XLS" files and is caused by the ElementInfo stored in "currentElement".

Each time a new element is started (method startElement) the current elment is newly overwritten with 

currentElement = new ElementInfo(currentElement, namespaces);

where the existing element is used as the parent element. Since the currentElement is not reset to the parent element after finishing the element (method: endElement) the method getPrefix recursively traverses the parents and finally causes the StackOverFlowError

For my understanding: something like:

currentElement = currentElement.parent;

in the endElement method solves the issue!
