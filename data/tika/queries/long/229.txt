While we just have a single LICENSE and NOTICE file for the Tika source tree, the appropriate licensing information for the binary artifacts of each of the three Tika components is different. To better manage all the relevant licensing information for each release artifact (both source and binaries) I'd like to add separate LICENSE and NOTICE files to src/main/resources/META-INF of all the Tika components. These files would apply to and be included in the binary artifacts generated by the Tika build.
