there are several methods in this class that are targeted for different image type but with different visibility:

public void parseJpeg(File file);
protected void parseTiff(InputStream stream);

both simply extract all possible metadata from image file or stream. Would be nice if parseTiff could also be "public" so it will be easier to create custom parsers located in external jars that use this functionality.
