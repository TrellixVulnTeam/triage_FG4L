I'd like to be be able to detect .webarchive files. They are a special case of the Apple Binary Property list format. They are generated by the Safari browser and contain all the files that comprise a web page within a single container file.

Can anyone supply an example file? All the ones I have are confidential and I don't have a mac myself.
