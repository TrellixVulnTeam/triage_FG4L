A Number of the parser implementations create one large String of the content and then pass it to the ContentHandler. Would be better to just write to the ContentHandler its parsed. Attaching a patch which changes the parsing to write to an "Appendable" (which java.io.Writer implements since JDK 1.5) and changes to XMLContentHandler to also implement Appendable.
