As discussed earlier on the mailing list [1], I requested Nexus access for Tika (see INFRA-2197). We now have that, so we just need to upgrade the Tika build to start taking advantage of the repository.apache.org server. To do that, I'll be upgrading our POMs to use the latest org.apache:apache:6 parent POM and tweaking things like the Hudson build and our release process.
