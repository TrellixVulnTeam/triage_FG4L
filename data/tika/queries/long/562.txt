A couple of file types have application/x-tika-msoffice as their parent, when they should have application/x-tika-ooxml. This error is exhibited when you try to identify those files with both name and data. The data is found to be x-tika-ooxml, while the type found with the name is correct, but since it's not a subtype of x-tika-ooxml - it is not returned.
