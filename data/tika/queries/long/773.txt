As a followup to TIKA-212 and inspired by efforts like [1], I'd like to set up a .NET version of Tika based on IKVM and NPanday. The goal would be to produce a Tika DLL that contains all the parser libraries and can be used natively in any .NET environment with some API sugar on top to make the Tika facade class work more smoothly with .NET (for example, use System.IO.FileInfo instead of java.io.File).
