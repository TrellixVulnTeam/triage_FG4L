With POI 3.8 beta 1, there's an alternate OLE2 implementation NPOIFSFileSystem. From an API level, it's very similar to the existing POIFSFileSystem class, but internally it's lower memory and generally faster.

While NPOIFSFileSystem is currently read only (the write support has a couple of gaps), for Tika's needs that isn't an issue

We should therefore switch our uses of POIFSFileSystem to NPOIFSFileSystem to reduce memory and enhance speed.
