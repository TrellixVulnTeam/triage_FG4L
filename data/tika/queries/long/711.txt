We seem not to extract the optional hyphen character correctly in
the Word parser.

You can create this char in Word by typing ctrl and -.  It's hidden,
normally; you have to turn on display of formatting marks to see it.

Ideally we'd get U+00AD (unicode soft hyphen), I think.

DOC produces a unicode replacement char, which is wrong.

DOCX and PDF drop the char (which seems acceptable).  RTF produces
U+2027 (hyphenation point) which also seems OK (in TIKA-683 it will
produce U+00AD).

PPT and PPTX work correctly (U+00AD).

So DOC is the only bug I think â€“ I haven't dug into what's wrong
yet...
