Currently, to get a parsed document's content value (e.g. title), one must do something like this:

        Content content = getContent(name);

        return content != null
                ? content.getValue()
                : null;

I'd like to suggest we create a method that does that in one place, so that users do not need to do that themselves.

Patch coming momentarily...
