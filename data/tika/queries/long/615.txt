As of POI 3.8 beta 2, POI will support decoding TNEF (winamil.dat) files. (The code is in SVN, but just missed being in 3.8 beta 1)

This issue is to track adding support to Tika for getting:

	message contents (the RTF of the message body)
	message metadata (probably just the subject for now)
	attachment contents + metadata (via the usual container contents method)
