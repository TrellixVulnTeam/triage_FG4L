I noticed today that Tika can't detect a lot of common database formats, such as sqlite or Berkeley DB or MISAM

The unix file utility got most of those, which makes me think that there's a sensible-ish header on most we can write some mime magic for

It'd therefore be good to add mime entries, with magic where possible, for many of these common database file formats
