Would it be possible to add the Mime Types of these programming lanuages from the attached custom-mimetypes.xml into the tika-mimetypes.xml-file?


	Asciidoc: text/x-asciidoc
	D: text/x-d
	HAML: text/x-haml
	Haxe: text/x-haxe
	R: text/x-rsrc
	XQuery: application/xquery



These mimetypes are also used in other projects like the CodeMirror editor.
