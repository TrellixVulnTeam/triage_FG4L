While parsing a set of small HTML files (email messages), I noticed using a profiler that about a third of the time was being spent in the construction of tagsoup's HTMLSchema class.

Since this is (or appears to be to me) simply a data structure, it is thread safe and can be reused. Fortunately this can be done easily, as shown in the patch I will attach to this issue.
