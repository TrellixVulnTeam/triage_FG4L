Currently, we don't have mimetype entries for DITA. There is a provisional mimetype

According to http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/cs01/spec/non-normative/DITA-mime-type.html there is a provisional mimetype of "application/dita+xml" for DITA files

There are then three kinds of DITA file, which apparently all use the same mimetype:
 DITA Topic - .dita
 DITA Map - .ditamap
 DITA Conditional Processing Profile - .ditaval

DITA is XML based, so we should be able to do XML detection in addition to filename matching
