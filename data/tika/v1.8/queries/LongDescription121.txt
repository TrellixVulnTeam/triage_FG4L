For some reason, in r591743 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=591743&view=rev), the MimeType.clean functionality was removed and never replaced. This is a problem because that functionality was somewhat necessary as I'm running into the problem of trying to upgrade Nutch to tika-0.1-incubating and Nutch relied on MimeType.clean.

I've been scratching my head trying to determine an appropriate workaround for the same capability within the tika-0.1-incubating code, but have yet to find one. This functionality needs to be replaced in some form or fashion, or, if someone knows of a simple way to achieve the same functionality, please let me know.
