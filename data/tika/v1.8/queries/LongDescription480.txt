Currently BoilerpipeContentHandler will call the provided delegate ContentHandler with:

<p>xxx</p>

for each block of text. But without the wrappers around these elements, things like BodyContentHandler can't be used.

In addition, current BoilerpipeContentHandler emits a <p> element with a null attributes value, which will cause a NPE for BodyContentHandler.
