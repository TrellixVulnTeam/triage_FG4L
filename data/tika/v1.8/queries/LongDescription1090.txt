As I described on user@ here [0], I was not happy with the Javadoc for Metadata (as it was not explicit about what to replace the legacy Tika Metadata vocabulary with) so I therefore thought it was important to provide a documentation patch to make it more clear to devs/users wishing to build on the Tika Metadata functionality.
This simple patch merely substantiates on the Java documentation for the Metadata class further explaining how the Tika API has changed. In addition other methods now are explicit about what we SHOULD now use. Finally, it also introduces a Feed.java metadata interface (which I can remove if unnecessary/unrequired) which merely introduces some consistent fields we would expect Rome rss/atom/feed parser library to obtain. The final Feed class is a legacy class from the Apache Nutch metadata package.

I will work on the patch today and submit it here in due course.
