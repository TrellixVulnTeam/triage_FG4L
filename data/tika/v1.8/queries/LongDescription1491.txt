Following the release of the BPG (Better Portable Graphics) format a few days ago, I created the magic definitions for this format. See attached file. I've tested this against the example files listed here.

Note that no officially registered MIME type exists for this format. I picked image/bpg as this would be the most obvious choice, but I don't know if Tika sticks to any policy in such cases?
