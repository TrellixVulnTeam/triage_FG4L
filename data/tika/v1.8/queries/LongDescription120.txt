It would be nice if Tika could retrieve ID3 tags from MP3 files.

There are a number of libraries that could be used:
MyID3 (Apache License) http://www.fightingquaker.com/myid3/
jd3Lib (LGPL) http://sourceforge.net/projects/jd3lib/
javamusictag (LGPL) http://javamusictag.sourceforge.net/
jaudiotagger (LGPL) https://jaudiotagger.dev.java.net/

There might be others (with more Apache-friendly licenses).
