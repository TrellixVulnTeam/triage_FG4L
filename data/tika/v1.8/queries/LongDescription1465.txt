Speaking to Eric Nienhouse at the ongoing NSF funded Polar Cyberinfrastructure hackathon in NYC, we became aware that variables parameters contained within netCDF3 and netCDF4 are just as valuable (if not more valuable) as global attribute values. 
AFAIK, right now we only extract global attributes however we could extend the support to cater for the above observations.
