Some parsers are now able to generate img tags in their HTML, in the spot where an embedded image lives

I think it would be nice to show these images in the GUI in the graphical view. The attached patch will allow the GUI to spot when an embedded: img link is found, re-write it to be in a URL to the temporary directory, and also request the recursing parser capture it.

The result is that you can drop a suitable file (eg .docx) onto the gui, and in the Formatted Text pane see the image inline

Are people happy with the patch? (and the idea?)
