I was demoing the tika app to some people today, and one of them asked which parsers it supported, and how they can easily check that into the future following upgrades

With this in mind, I'm planning to add two new options to the command line interface of tika app. The simpler one will be to list the parsers that will be used in processing your documents. The longer one will be to list the parsers, and for each parser which mime types it supports

I'm thinking of options of:
  --list-parsers = list the parsers
  --list-parser-details = list the parsers and their mime types

If anyone has any suggestions on option names, or anything similar that should be added at the same time, do please comment
