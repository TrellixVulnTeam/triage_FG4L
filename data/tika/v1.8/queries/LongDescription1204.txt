DWFX are AutoCAD Design web format files and follow Open Packaging Conventions. 
Tika "correctly" detects these files as application/zip. 
It would be better if Tika could recognize the true mimetype: model/vnd.dwfx+xps. 
Please add logic in ZipContainerDetector in such a way could be possible to detect dwfx. We need a method behaving like detectOfficeOpenXML(OPCPackage pkg): 


PackageRelationshipCollection core = pkg.getRelationshipsByType("http://schemas.autodesk.com/dwfx/2007/relationships/documentsequence");
if (core.size() != 1) {
 // Invalid DWFX Package received
 return null;
}
PackagePart corePart = pkg.getPart(core.getRelationship(0));
String coreType = corePart.getContentType();
return MediaType.parse(coreType);


Thank you,
Marco
