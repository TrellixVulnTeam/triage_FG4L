ImageMetadatExtractor is (indirectly) using a retired Java API, resulting in compilation error under Java 7:

tika-parsers/src/main/java/org/apache/tika/parser/image/ImageMetadataExtractor.java:[89,34] error: cannot access JPEGDecodeParam
[ERROR]   class file for com.sun.image.codec.jpeg.JPEGDecodeParam not found



It's possible upgrading to the latest metadata-extractor might fix this... (we use 2.4.0-beta-1 but there's now a 2.5.0-RC2: http://code.google.com/p/metadata-extractor).
