In TIKA-1442 text extraction from files like 717226.pdf that don't have text extraction permission works. The permissions in PDF files are only enforced by the application (i.e. PDFBox), i.e. the text information isn't stored separately in encrypted form. 

PDFBox ExtractText command line does throw an exception.
So I wonder why TIKA is able to extract text. Either TIKA or the PDFBox call used bypasses the permission checking.
