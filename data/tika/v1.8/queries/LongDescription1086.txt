The tika-bundle 1.3 version does not import org.w3c.dom package, as a result it is not able to parse DOM based documents such as Microsoft Word (docx) documents.

This issue does not have in version 1.2 as it does import the necessary package and therefore the parsing of the documents work fine.

Can someone please look into the issue, as Microsoft Word is a very popular document.
