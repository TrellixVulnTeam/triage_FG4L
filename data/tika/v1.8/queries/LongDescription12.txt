Assuming we will need to work with URL's, it would be helpful for MimeTypesUtils to return the mime type for a URL.  Currently it only works on Files.

I think we will need to handle URL's.  My immediate need for URL's is to use getClass().getResource("a_config_file_name") to locate configuration files at test time.
