Some of the parsers try to set the secure-processing feature that JAXP requires all parser implementations to support. Unfortunately some XML parsers don't support the feature, which causes the following exception: 

org.xml.sax.SAXNotRecognizedException: Feature 'http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/feature/secure-processing' is not recognized.
