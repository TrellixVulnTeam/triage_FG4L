I am including 3 files. Two of these (Employee Application.pdf; pertoc.html) parsed without error under Tika 0.7. The third (I-9.pdf) fails under both versions and is included more as another test case for PDF parse errors.

Perltoc.html fails with a Null Pointer exception in org.apache.tika.parser.html.HtmlParser@53786b79. Employee Application.pdf fails in  org.apache.tika.parser.pdf.PDFParser@39fb9fb3, also with a Null Pointer exception. Both cases repro with tikaapp.jar built from the 0.8 release.

I-9 (which also fails under 0.7, but for different reasons) also fails with a Null Pointer exception at the same location as Employee Application.pdf.

Looks like I have to create the bug before I can attach files...
