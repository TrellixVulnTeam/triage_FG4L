I was trying to figure out why my xpath expressions weren't working in Solr Cell (a Tika adapter to Solr) and it turns out that it's because of Tika's more limited XPath support. I was hoping to find documentation on what is supported. The best I found was the javadocs here: http://tika.apache.org/0.8/api/org/apache/tika/sax/xpath/XPathParser.html  It lists the supported XPath axis but it fails to mention that document:node() is supported too.  As an aside, I believe this is erroneous as there should be two colons.
