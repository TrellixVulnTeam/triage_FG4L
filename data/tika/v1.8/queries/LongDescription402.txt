It would be nice to have support for documents created by Apple's Keynote and Pages applications. Both file formats are described in http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/iWork2-0_XML/Chapter01/Introduction.html. I'm not sure if there already are open source parser libraries for these formats or if we'd need to directly process the XML content.
