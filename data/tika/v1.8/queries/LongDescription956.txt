You can see this with the recently added testWORD_embedded_pdf.doc
(for TIKA-948): the "Bye Bye" text comes before the "Wer
wjelrwoierj..." text from the embedded PDF, opposite of what you see
when you open the doc with Word.

Yet, the thumbnail images do seem to be extracted at the right place
(inlined).

This is because WordExtractor.java has a separate pass at the end to
visit the embedded docs.

Would it be possible to recurse into an embedded doc at the point when
it's first encountered instead...?  Or maybe somehow correlate the
images with their corresponding attachment (right now they are just
named image1, image2, ...)?
