Rev 1029510 introduces a regression in PDF content parsing, now present in 0.8 RC. Paragraphs from the PDF are no longer separated by newline. This is a problem both for reading and for indexing. See the attached test.

Note that it seems like PDFBox 1.3.1 extracts correctly, at least from command line. Here's from a sample file with a headline followed by a one word paragraph:
$> java -jar pdfbox-app-1.3.1.jar ExtractText -console docs/shortpdf.pdf
1   -    untitled 3   -    2010-02-13 09:52   -    Staffan Olsson

But Tika prints:
$> java -jar tika-app-0.9-20101110.175016-3.jar docs/shortpdf.pdf
...
