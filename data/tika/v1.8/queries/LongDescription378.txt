It would be nice if TikaConfig would somehow signal that it cannot load parser classes. Currently it just silently ignores all throwables.

I would be ok with about any kind of signaling (even just wrapping and rethrowing the exception). If we wan't to maintain back compat in functionality we could indroduce a new config option into the configuration file or a method in TikaConfig class that would enable rethrowing exceptions on parser initializations.

What do others think?
