I have an RTF document with the following snippet of content (it's an export of a private phone book so I can't share the full document):

{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\lang2055\langfe2055\langfenp2055\insrsid9461491\charrsid9461491 Fax / Phone Station\cell Fax / Phone #\cell }

The extracted text is:

Fax / Phone StationFax / Phone

Note how the cell boundary between "Station" and "Fax" is lost.
