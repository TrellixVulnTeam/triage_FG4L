There is a trivial bug in o.a.tika.server.TikaServerCLI where we double log that we are starting the server. The initial logging statement reading in static String value from a properties file. This static value is currently set to $
{project.version}
 which is strange...
Secondly, there is actually no requirement to have this file as this is the only property contained within the file and it is only used in this context.
This simple issue improves INFO logging to server initialization as well as removal of useless properties file.
