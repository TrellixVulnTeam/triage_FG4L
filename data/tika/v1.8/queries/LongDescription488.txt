Add additional search provider (to existed Lucid Find) search-lucene.com.

Initiated in discussion: http://www.search-lucene.com/m/uTJxE2kcRv1

Requirements (copied from discussion):

Jukka Zitting: "Ideally the search box would allow the user to choose which provider
to use. Something like a cookie that remembers the user's selection
would be nice. If the user doesn't make an explicit selection of the
provider, then one should be selected randomly for the first search
and remembered afterwards for consistency.

It would be great if the required logic was implemented on the client
side using javascript, as otherwise we'd need to start messing up with
CGI scripts, etc."
