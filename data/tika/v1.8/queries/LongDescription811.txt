The metadataextractor library (2.4.0-beta-1) is quite old and is depending on some Sun classes thus making it unable to run on openJDK 7 which is now the default JDK on Linux distributions.
Upgrading the library to the new version 2.5.0-RC3 fixes this issue but the API has changed.
Appending a patch to the MetadataExtactor class (and the tests) to take advantage of this.
