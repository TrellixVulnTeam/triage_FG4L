As part of TIKA-1302 and as part of making Tika more robust generally, it would be useful to have an evil parser that will throw exceptions/errors and hang for lengths of time.  

This will allow us to test timeouts and handling of exceptions and errors in tika-server and in tika-batch.  

We could also use this for tests with ForkParser.
