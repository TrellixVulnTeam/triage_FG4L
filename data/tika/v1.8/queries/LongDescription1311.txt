When json was initially added to TIKA CLI (TIKA-213), there was a recommendation to centralize JSON handling of Metadata, potentially putting it in core.  On a recent bug fix (TIKA-1291), the same recommendation was repeated especially noting that we now handle JSON/Metadata differently in CLI and server.

Let's centralize JSON handling in core and use GSON.  We should add a serializer and a deserializer so that users don't have to reinvent that wheel.
