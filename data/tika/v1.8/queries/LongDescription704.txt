Currently there appear to be issues with embedded pdf's and outlook Msg files contained in MS Word documents. I'll attach a sample for each and my recursive parser (incase the problem lies in there).

From what I see, when these embedded objects are parsed, they're initially identified as vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.oleObject in the metadata's Content-Type field. After a call to the RecurciveParsers super parse class the Content-Types update to the following:

PDF's: application/vnd.ms-works
.MSG: application/x-tika-msoffice

The internal AutoDetectParser is unable to properly identify these PDF's and therfore does not call the PDFParser on them.
