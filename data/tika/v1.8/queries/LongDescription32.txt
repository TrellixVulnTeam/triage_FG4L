A couple of methods in this class have an if clause for CDATA that are never called because the condition just previous to it is true:

               } else if (node instanceof Text) 
{
                    Text text = (Text) node;
                    values[i] = text.getText();
                }
 else if (node instanceof CDATA) {
                    CDATA cdata = (CDATA) node;
                    values[i] = cdata.getText();

Since CDATA extends Text, the Text clause will always be executed for a CDATA object, and not the CDATA clause.

In addition, the extractContent() and concatOccurrence() methods have many lines in common that could be extracted into a single common method.
