RTF supports lists, and the parser could support those, too, using HTML <ul>/<ol>/<li> tags.

I'm attaching a patch that implements basic support for Word 97 and newer lists. Nested lists are not supported correctly, yet, though, and a number of formatting options are ignored.

I've also added test cases for this, and adapted existing tests where needed.
