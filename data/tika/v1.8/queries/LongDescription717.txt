When I add an annotation or comment, I see that comment extracted for PPTX, DOC, DOCX, PDF (in one case) but not for RTF, PPT and PDF (in a different case).

I think I'll just commit the test with all docs, but leave the ones that don't work commented out; we can uncomment once we fix this bug.

I'll have a look at the RTF comment, but I'm not yet familiar enough w/ the other parsers to dig into them...
