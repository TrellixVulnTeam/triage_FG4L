In class AudioFrame the last two bits of the MPEG frame header are used to determine the number of channels. According to my documentation, this information is encoded in bits 7 and 6.

I did a cross check with the ID3 tag editor tool ID3-TagIT (http://www.id3-tagit.de/). The unit tests expect that the test MP3 files have 2 channels. However, the tool reports that the files are mono.
