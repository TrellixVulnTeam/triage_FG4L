When using Tika standalone jar after mvn install in CLI mode, in most of my test documents (pdf, doc, ppt, odt, ), the plain text output option (-t or --text) does not produce any result. When using the other options (xml, html, metadata), the output is correct. Activating debug mode (-v) does not produce additional info either.

When using the GUI, dragging and dropping does produce the expected results, also in the plain text tab/window

I rebuilt tika many times in the past 2 months (cleared .m2 directory every time) from svn (latest revision tried:  724002), the CLI --text result is always the same: usually missing output.

For now, I use the -x output option chained to html2txt as a workaround, but would prefer to use just tika to convert to plain text (which is used for further indexing in Solr).

Thanks
