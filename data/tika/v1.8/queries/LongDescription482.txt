When I added support for more image metadata in TIKA-472, i realized
the current design had some restrictions:

	I could not access the typed getters from Metadata Extractor, such
as getDate (to format iso date) and getStringArray (for keywords).
	The handler function was called one field at a time which prevents
logic where one field depends on the value of another (there is for
example record versions and fields that specify encoding)



See attached patch. It refactors TiffExtractor to MetadataExtractorExtractor.
The patch also includes the date fix, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-451#action_12898794

We can later add more Extractors using other libraries, and map to parsers based on format. For example we already use ImageIO in ImageParser so maybe there should be an ImageIOExtractor.
