Doesn't look like Tika properly detects the webp image format for content-type detection. The image container spec: developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/riff_container, and the wikipedia entry for webp: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP

Attached is the patch to src/main/resources/org/apache/tika/mime/tika-mimetypes.xml and a sample webp image.
