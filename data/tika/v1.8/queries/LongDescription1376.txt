When we extract embedded files from PDFs, we are currently using the key in the PDEmbeddedFilesNameTreeNode as the file name that we store as the value of Metadata.RESOURCE_NAME_KEY in the embedded document's  metadata.

I think we should try to get the file name from PDComplexFileSpecification's getFilename() first.  If that is null, then we should fall back to the key value.
