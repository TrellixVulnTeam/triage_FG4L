The attached patch adds support for a few more kinds of OpenDocument metadata. These are added to the metadata object much like the existing ones.

There's also support for  user defined metadata support. (Custom Metadata is stored in lines like <meta:user-defined meta:name="Info 1">Text 1</meta:user-defined>). There's a new MetadataHandler, AttributeDependantMetadataHandler, which can use the value of an attribute on the node to decide what to call the metadata when done with the node.

Also included are several more tests for the OpenDocument parser, and one more test file to go with this.
