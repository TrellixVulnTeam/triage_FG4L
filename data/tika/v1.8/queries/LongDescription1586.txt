Tika Server should allow configuration of CORS requests (for uses like TIKA-1585). See this example from CXF for how to add it.

The only change from that site is that we will need to add a CrossOriginResourceSharingFilter as a provider.

Ideally, this is configurable (limit which resources have CORS, and which origins are allowed). But, I'm not thinking of any general methods of how to do that...
