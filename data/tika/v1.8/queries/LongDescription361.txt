OutlookExtractor currently uses POIChunkParser, which is a somewhat internal class, and has recently undergone a large number of changes.

The attached patch changes OutlookExtractor to use the more stable MAPIMessage for text extraction, which allows it to continue extracting with the latest POI code in svn.

The changes in POI's svn also allow for easy access to a few more bits of the message. The patch adds date support, but possibly a few others will be wanted in future as well.
