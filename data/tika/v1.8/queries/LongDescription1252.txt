When submitting a PDF with this information in its XMP metadata:
...
      <dc:creator>
        <rdf:Bag>
          <rdf:li>Author 1</rdf:li>
          <rdf:li>Author 2</rdf:li>
        </rdf:Bag>
      </dc:creator>
...
Only the first one appears in the collection:
...
        "author":["Author 1"],
        "author_s":"Author 1",
...

In spite of having set the field to multiValued in the Solr schema:

<field name="author" type="text_general" indexed="true" stored="true" multiValued="true"/>

Let me know if there's any further specific information I could provide.

Thanks in advance!
