The Lius Lite code from TIKA-7 (most notably the org.apache.tika.utils.MimeTypeUtils class) depends on the jmimeinfo library [1] by Andy Hedges. Unfortunately jmimeinfo is GPL software, so we can't depend on it. I will remove the dependency and hope that TIKA-6 or another similar effort will come up with a good replacement.
