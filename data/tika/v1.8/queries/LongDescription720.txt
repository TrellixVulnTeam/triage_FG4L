I have a test file encoded in EBCDIC, but Tika fails to detect it.

Not sure we can realistically fix this; I have no idea how (and,
realistically, one really ought to convert out of EBCDIC on export
from a mainframe...).

Here's what Tika detects:


Shift_JIS:      confidence=51
Big5:           confidence=40
GB18030:        confidence=10
KOI8-R:         confidence=5
windows-1252:   confidence=5
windows-1253:   confidence=2
IBM866:         confidence=1
windows-1251:   confidence=1
windows-1250:   confidence=1



The test file decodes fine as cp500; eg in Python just run this:


import codecs
codecs.getdecoder('cp500')(open('English_EBCDIC.txt').read())
