This is a teensy suggestion for change in word choice. 

On http://lucene.apache.org/tika/gettingstarted.html, under Getting and building the sources, it says "Executing the following command in the source directory will build the sources and install the resulting artifacts in your local Maven repository."

I looked at the directory structure of  the project and figured "source directory" meant apache-tika-0.4/src. Since I'm a maven newbie, it took me about an hour to figure out the meaning of the error I got when invoking "mvn install" from that directory:

    "Cannot execute mojo: resources. It requires a project with an existing pom.xml, but the build is not using one."

Now I know I gotta invoke maven in a directory that has a pom.xml file, and the root one for Tika is the one in apache-tika-0.4.

Might save other twits an hour to change the word "source" to "base" or similar in the sentence I quoted here.

P.S. - You need to mark version 0.4 as a released version in JIRA.
