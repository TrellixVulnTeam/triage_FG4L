I was having issues during installation of Tika 1.7 where the build failed when running parser tests (specifically on TestChmExtraction). I had set the MAVEN_OPTS variable to have enough memory (-Xmx2048m), but the build still failed. I turned out that the maven-surefire-plugin was creating a new JVM that did not have enough specified memory, causing TestChmExtraction to fail. A fix I found online led me to change the POM for tika-parent (adding an argLine to maven-surefire-plugin, where -Xmx2048m worked). After adding this, the installation was able to finish. I will submit a pull request with the addition.
