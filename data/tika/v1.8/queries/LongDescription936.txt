When extracting from the zip files which are zipped at Windows OS(Japanese), the file name extracted from zip is garbled.

ZipArchiveInputStream has three constructors. Modifying like the below, the file name was not garbled. I specified the encoding - SJIS.

PackageExtractor

public void parse(InputStream stream)
 :
 //unpack(new ZipArchiveInputStream(stream), xhtml);  
 unpack(new ZipArchiveInputStream(stream,"SJIS",true), xhtml); 
 :



In first constructor the platform's default encoding UTF-8 is used.  In my case the encoding of my computer is UTF-8, the encoding of zip file is SJIS, so the file name was garbled. We will get garbled file name if there is a difference of  encoding between platform this constructor and zip file.

I want Tika to parse zip by giving some kind of encoding parameter per file, Where should I give the encoding, somewhere in Metadata or ParseContext? Please support this. I am using Tika via Solr(SolrCell), so when posting zip file to Solr I want to add encoding parameter to the request.
