Good morning,
Crawling legacy sites with poorly written html fragments causes severe Solr Xml parse errors and in turn causes ManifoldCF to abort.
Can we add <div> to the list of heuristics so the html parser is used instead of the xml parser?
see this ticket for further information: TIKA-1101

Thank you,
