I have noticed that some famous programming lanuages get not detected in the tika-mimetypes.xml-file:


	Clojure: text/x-clojure
	CoffeeScript: text/x-coffeescript
	Go: text/x-go
	Less: text/x-less
	OCaml: text/x-ocaml
	Property files, INI-Files
	reStructuredText: text/x-rst
	Scala: text/x-scala
	Smalltalk: text/x-stsrc
	Yaml: text/x-yaml



The mimetypes are taken from the CodeMirror editor.

It would be very helpfull for me, if also these types will get detected.
