When processing tika-mimetypes.xml, additional supertype information should be set so that the right parser gets called if there's no explicit parser for that mime-type.

Jukka suggested:

The type registry could do with some implicit supertype settings like the following (in order):


	a type with an explicit <sub-class-of/> setting is a specialization
of the specified type
	a type with parameters is a specialization of the same type without parameters
	all /+xml types are specializations of application/xml
	all text/* types are specializations of text/plain
	everything is a specialization of application/octet-stream
