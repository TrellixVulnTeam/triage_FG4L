I'd like to identify the PDF version of files, this is not currently reported by the PDFParser although the information is available via PDFBox.  I have attached a patch that adds the format version to the Metadata object.

However, I am not familiar enough with the Tika source to know if an alternative metadata key should be used, or this new one added.

Comments welcome.
