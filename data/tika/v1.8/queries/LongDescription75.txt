We have a MimeUtils method that returns a MIME type based solely on the name.  It would be very helpful to also have a method that examines the header as well.  I've added a method (patch coming) that does this.  It opens a stream from the URL, reads the header, closes the stream, and then calls the existing method.

This may not be usable in the course of parsing, since it violates our decision to read a stream only once.  However, it is very useful as a way to test our MIME type determination, and as a non-parse service to our users (as recently discussed on the forum).
