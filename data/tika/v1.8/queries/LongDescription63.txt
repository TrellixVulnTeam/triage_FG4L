The current Excel, Word, and PowerPoint parsers make multiple passes over the given input stream - first to read document metadata, and then to extract text content. We can avoid this duplicate consumption by using the POIFSFileSystem class as a source of both the metadata and text content in the parser classes since these Office documents are in any case parsed into memory.
