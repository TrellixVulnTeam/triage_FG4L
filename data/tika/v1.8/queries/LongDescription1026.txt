Currently the ServiceLoader and TikaActivator classes simply maintain an unordered collection of the Parser and Detector services currently available in an OSGi environment. This is troublesome in the case where there are for example two Parser services that both cover the same media type, and one of them should be preferred. The OSGi way for specifying such preferences is through service ranking, but that currently doesn't work with Tika.
