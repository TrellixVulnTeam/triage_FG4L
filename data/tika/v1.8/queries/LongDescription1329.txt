Jukka and Nick have a great demo of parsing metadata recursively on the wiki.  For TIKA-1302, I'd like to use something similar, and I think that others may find it useful for tika-app and tika-server.

I took the code from the wiki and made some modifications.  I'm not sure if we should put this in parsers or in a new module for "examples."  Given that I think this would be useful for tika-app and tika-server, I'd prefer parsers, but I'm open to any input...including "let's not."
