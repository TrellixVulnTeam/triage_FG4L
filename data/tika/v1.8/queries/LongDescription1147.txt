When an application using Tika passes InputStream objects to ExternalEmbedder.embed the stream is usually read into a temporary file which is then deleted after embedding takes place.

However, if the application passes in a file-based TikaInputStream the embedder ends up dealing with directly with the original source file, which is then deleted after embedding takes place.
