Mime type detector using AutoDetectParser and Metadata returns "application/xml" for the URL http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#, where it should be "application/rdf+xml". The correct mime type is also suggested here: http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#MIMEType.

P.S., Tika was downloaded from svn and built with Maven last week.
