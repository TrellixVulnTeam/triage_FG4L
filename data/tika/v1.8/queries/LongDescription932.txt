There's a denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2012-2098) in Commons Compress versions up to 1.4 (we currently use 1.3) that can be triggered with a specially crafted bzip2 document.

Tika already has higher-level features (ForkParser, etc.) for dealing with problems like this, but it would in any case be good to upgrade our Commons Compress dependency to the new 1.4.1 release that fixes the vulnerability.
