The TesseractOCRParser is great but configuration at the moment requires configuring up a TesseractOCRConfig instance and placing it on the ParseContext.  For those who are not using Tika programmatically in their code, such as users of the Tika Server, this is difficult and requires code changes. It would be more helpful is this could also be configured using a properties file on the classpath.
