The ICU4J library that we use for handling plain text documents is pretty large (4.3MB) and we only need a small subset of its functionality.

I just asked [1] for ICU4J to provide a smaller component jar that we could depend on, but until that happens I'd like to simply replace the entire dependency with copies of relevant classes from ICU4J.
