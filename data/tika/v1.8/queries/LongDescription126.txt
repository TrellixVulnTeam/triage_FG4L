In some cases a client is just interested in the parsed metadata and not the extracted text content. It is easy to ignore the text content by just passing a dummy DefaultHandler to the existing parse() method, but many parsers could avoid a lot of work if they knew in advance that the text content is not needed.

Thus I want to add a parse(InputStream, Metadata) signature to the Parser interface. I'll also add an AbstractParser base class with a trivial implementation of that method:

    public abstract AbstractParser implements Parser {
        public void parse(InputStream stream, Metadata metadata) 
{
            parse(stream, new DefaultHandler(), metadata);
        }
    }
