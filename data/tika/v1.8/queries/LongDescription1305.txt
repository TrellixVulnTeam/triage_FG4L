Some RTFs cause RTFParser to throw a RuntimeException:

Unexpected RuntimeException from org.apache.tika.parser.rtf.RTFParser@425e60f2

When tracing in the debugger (surfaces in CompositeParser.parse() where it catches the RuntimeException, line 244 in my copy), the exception (e) is:

java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1

A committer (Tim Allison) believes that it is being caused by recent list processing changes.
