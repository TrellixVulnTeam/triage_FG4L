When using Tika.detect() on iWork files, it always returns application/zip. Although the ZipContainerDetector is called by the CompositeDetector, the iWork mime types (application/vnd.apple.keynote, application/vnd.apple.pages, application/vnd.apple.numbers) are not configured to be subtypes of application/vnd.apple.iwork or application/zip.
