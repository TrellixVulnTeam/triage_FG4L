From the investigations done for TIKA-851, it looks like a parser for the Quicktime format, and MP4 (which is an extension to it) shouldn't be too hard to do. This should be able to output some of the media metadata, such duration, dimensions, and MP4 audio tags

Information resources on the format are linked from TIKA-851
