The current Parser classes take a List<Content> collection from ParserConfig, and explicitly reformat that collection into an internal Map<String,Content> map keyed by the Content names. I don't see any place where using a list of Content instances is better than a Map keyed by the Content names, so I'd like to simplify things by creating the map already in ParserConfig and using it directly ever since.
