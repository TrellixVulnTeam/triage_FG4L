Tika should automatically detect and decode stream compression formats like gzip or bzip2. When parsing, such compression should be mentioned in the resulting metadata (compression=gzip), but should not otherwise affect the result of the parsing. In other words, the extracted text content should be the same regardless of whether the input stream has been compressed or not.
