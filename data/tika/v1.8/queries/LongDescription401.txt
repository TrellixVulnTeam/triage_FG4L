We ran into an issue recently where Tika's AutoDetectParser hung on a corrupt zip file.
(CPU load constantly at 100%, and the call to AutoDetectParser's parse never returned).

I traced it to a bug in Commons Compress 1.0 : http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COMPRESS-96 which has been fixed in their latest trunk.

When I try Tika on the same zipfile with a locally built commons-compress-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar (from SVN r925271) everything works correctly and Tika just throws a TikaException.

Would it be possible to upgrade to the latest Commons Compress trunk ?

Thanks.
