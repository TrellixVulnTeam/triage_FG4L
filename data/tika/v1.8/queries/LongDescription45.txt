RereadableInputStream reads a stream's content into a store (memory or file) on its first pass.  If rewind() is called before end of stream is reached, the bytes not yet read will not be available on subsequent reads of the RereadableInputStream.  This could be a problem, for example, if a parser uses it to get metadata from the beginning of a stream and calls rewind(), expecting to get the entire document.
