Currently the mime repo does not support java regular expressions as specifications for glob patterns. It would be nice to support this, e.g., with a flag such as:

<glob pattern="\d
{4}
*.txt" isregex="true"/>

When specified and set to "true", the flag would indicate that a glob pattern is to be interpreted as a java regular expression, rather than a std freedesktop.org mime glob pattern.

Patch forthcoming.
