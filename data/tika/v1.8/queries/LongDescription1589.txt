Steps to reproduce:


	Have a file without any ID3 tags (v1 or v2)
	Parse the file
	Attempt to retrieve the duration by calling 'metadata.get(XMPDM.DURATION)'.



Expected result:
The duration should be set even for a file without ID3 tags, since it is independent information.

Actual result:
The duration is null
