in org.apache.tika.utils.Utils the getUTF8Reader method assigns a language determination without checking the confidence rating from ICU's CharsetDetector.

Please add a configurable level (0-100);

if (language != null && match.getConfidence() > THRESHOLD) 
{
  metadata.set(Metadata.CONTENT_LANGUAGE, match.getLanguage());
  metadata.set(Metadata.LANGUAGE, match.getLanguage());
}

Obviously using charset to imply language is generally weak but it would be sufficient if the confidence threshold was controlled. Today, the text "hello" is tagged as French, for example.
