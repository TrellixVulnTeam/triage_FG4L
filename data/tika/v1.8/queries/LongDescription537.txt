The command line options --list-parsers and --list-parser-details are very useful to quickly see which parsers and mime-types are configured.

However, after the introduction of DefaultParser, the list has become less useful as it only lists the DefaultParser with all mime-types as children.

A better way would be to list the 2nd level parsers below the CompositeParser:



org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser (Composite Parser):
  org.apache.tika.parser.asm.ClassParser
    application/java-vm
  org.apache.tika.parser.audio.AudioParser
    audio/x-aiff
    audio/x-wav
    audio/basic
    [...]
