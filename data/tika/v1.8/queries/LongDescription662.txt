POI provides two ways to open OPCPackage - via InputStream and via File. Creating OPCPackage from InputStream casuses creation of ZipInputStreamZipEntrySource, that buffers all uncompressed data in memory. This takes a lot of memory and it is not needed when we are reading files from disk or when we already copied stream into temporary file.

This patch removes usage of ZipInputStreamZipEntrySource in this case.

Unfortunately, it breaks ZIP-bomb prevention for OOXML parser (and other parsers that uses TikaInputStream.getFile()). I think that ZIP-bomb prevention should be additionally implemented for that formats before committing this to SVN.
