This version should be able to demonstrate as many of Apache Tika's capabilities as possible. For instance with GDAL, Tesseract, and FFmpeg to show parsers which require installation of other dependencies. In addition, this should help move TIKA-1301 forward and should leverage the suggestion made by Lewis John McGibbney of a script which can pull down the latest version of Apache Tika.
