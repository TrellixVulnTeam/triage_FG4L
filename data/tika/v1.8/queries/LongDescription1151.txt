The Maven build should be updated to produce test jar artifacts for appropriate sub-projects (see below) such that developers can extend test classes by adding the test-jar artifact as a dependency, i.e.:


    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.tika</groupId>
      <artifactId>tika-parsers</artifactId>
      <version>1.6-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <type>test-jar</type>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>



The following sub-projects contain tests that developers might want to extend and their corresponding pom.xml should have the attached tests added:

	tika-app
	tika-core
	tika-parsers
	tika-server
	tika-xmp
