Here is how the dependencu is declared:


    <dependency>
      <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
      <artifactId>vorbis-java-core</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
      <classifier>tests</classifier>
      <scope>test,provided</scope>
    </dependency>



It's the first time I see such a multiple scope.

Among other things it make the Maven WAR plugin include this dependency as if it was a build scope dependency.


I don't know if this worked in old version of Maven but org.apache.maven.model.Dependency has only one scope for sure.
