There's no mimetype detection for Matroska format, although it's a popular video format.
Here is some code I added in my custom mimetypes to detect them:



	<mime-type type="video/x-matroska">
		<glob pattern="*.mkv" />
		<magic priority="40">
			<match value="0x1A45DFA3934282886d6174726f736b61" type="string" offset="0" />
		</magic>
	</mime-type>
	<mime-type type="audio/x-matroska">
		<glob pattern="*.mka" />
	</mime-type>


I found the signature for the mkv on: 
http://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html
I was not able to find it clearly for mka, but detection by filename is still useful.

Although, the full spec is available here:

Maybe it's a bit more complex than this constant magic, but it works on my tests files.
