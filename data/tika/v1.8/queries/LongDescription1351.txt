Applications which want to let users search documents based only on their metadata do not need to get the content parsed. 
The only workaround I've found so far is to pass a no op content handler which can ignore the content events but it does not stop the parser such as PDFParser from parsing the content.

Proposal: update parser API docs to let implementers know ContentHandler can be null and update the shipped implementations to parse the metadata only if ContentHandler is null
