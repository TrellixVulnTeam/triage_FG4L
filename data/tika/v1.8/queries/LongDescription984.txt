On a German locale I get the following test failures:
Failed tests:
testJPEGGeo(org.apache.tika.parser.jpeg.JpegParserTest): expected:<12[.]54321> but was:<12[,]54321>
  testJPEGGeo2(org.apache.tika.parser.jpeg.JpegParserTest): expected:<51[.]575762> but was:<51[,]575762>

I can provide a patch to make the test pass, but I wonder whether it is desired that the output depends on the locale. This makes it harder for client applications to evaluate parsing results.

The cause of the problem seems to be the field GEO_DECIMAL_FORMAT in class ImageMetadataExtractor. The formatted strings produced by this object are locale-dependent.
