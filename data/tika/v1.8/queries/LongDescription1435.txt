Rome 1.5 has been released to Sonatype (https://github.com/rometools/rome/issues/183). Though the website (http://rometools.github.io/rome/) is blissfully ignorant of that. The update is mostly maintenance, adopting slf4j and generics as well as moving the namespace from com.sun.syndication to com.rometools. PR upcoming.
