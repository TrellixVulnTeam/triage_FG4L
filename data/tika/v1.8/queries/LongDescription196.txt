As reported by Dmitry Kudryavtsev on the mailing list, the TikaConfig class does not work on Java 1.4 even in the retrotranslated -jdk14 version.

Dmitry explains:

> parsers.put(mime.getTextContent().trim(), parser);
> ...
> <===
> 
> in  constructor TikaConfig(Element element) should be replaced with code
> like:

> Node txtNode = mime.getFirstChild();
> if ( txtNode != null )
{
>    parsers.put(txtNode.getNodeValue().trim(), parser);
> }
> <===

> This is important because Node.getTextContent not available in java 1.4 and
> tika-jdk1.4 become useless.
