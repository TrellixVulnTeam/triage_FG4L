The votes to graduate Tika from the Incubator to Lucene have passed.

Here's a list of things we need to do to implement the graduation:


	Migrate the mailing lists
	Update the issue tracker (TIKA is in group Lucene, not Incubator)
	Migrate the web site to lucene.apache.org/tika
	Remove incubation disclaimers
	Move the codebase from incubator/tika to lucene/tika
	Update the svn authorization and commit notification settings
	Update the incubation records to reflect graduation



The purpose of this issue is to track progress on these tasks.
