I'm trying to extract the text content from RTF documents. The files contain empty lines (two or more consecutive paragraph-end marks), on which the further processing relies to tell apart different parts of the text. But unfortuantely Tika (with --text switch) eliminates all those empty lines, instead of preserving them.
