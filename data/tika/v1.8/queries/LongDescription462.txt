TIKA-420 adds the BoilerpipeContentHandler to Tika. This requires the boilerpipe 1.0.4 jar, which in turn means the tika-parsers pom has to reference the java.net Maven repo, which is where this jar is currently located.

But this means Tika can no longer be pushed to the Maven central repo, as no external dependencies are allowed.

So prior to the 0.8 release, we should do a one-shot upload of boilerpipe 1.0.4 to Sonatype, which in turn will sync it to Maven central.
