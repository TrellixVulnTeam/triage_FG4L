Spinoff from TIKA-1072.

In that issue, a problematic document (still not sure if document is corrupt, or possible POI bug) caused an exception when visiting the embedded documents.

If I change Tika to suppress that exception, the rest of the document extracts fine.

So somehow I think we should be more robust here, and maybe log the exception, or save/record the exception(s) somewhere so after parsing the app could decide what to do about them ...
