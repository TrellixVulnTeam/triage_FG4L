MailContentHandler is called from RFC822Parser, and it creates AutoDetectParser on each call to parse(...). The process of creating AutoDetectParser involves reading TikaConfig (not cached), which in turn involves parsing XML config files. Apart from the fact that this process is wasteful and heavy, in addition in a highly concurrent setup it leads to multiple threads blocking on SAX parser creation.
