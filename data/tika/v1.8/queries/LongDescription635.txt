I'm doing a couple of Tika demos in the near future and would like to spice up the Tika GUI a bit to make it more demoable and easier for fresh new users to play with. For example I'd like to replace the current tab structure with a menubar for File (open file/url, etc.), View (current tab selection) and About (help, notice, license, etc.) options. It would also be great to have the tika-app jar launch the GUI when double-clicked in a file explorer.
