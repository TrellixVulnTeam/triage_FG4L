When running in Java 1.4, some of the Parser classes can't be loaded due to dependencies (POI, etc.) that require Java 5 or higher. These cases throw UnsupportedClassVersionErrors or somilar Throwables that aren't caught by the current "catch (Exception e)" clause. We should catch all Throwables there.
