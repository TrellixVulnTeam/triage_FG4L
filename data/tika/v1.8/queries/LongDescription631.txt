There are two areas in the outlook parsing that could use some enhancement:

	If the text content is stored as non unicode strings, we should try to have the right encoding used for this
	If the email contains a html or rtf version of the message body, we should prefer this over the plain text one



Note - some of these enhancements may need to wait for POI 3.8 beta 3
