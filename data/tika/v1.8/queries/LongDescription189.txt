I plan on using Tika to extract text from Excel (both .xls and .xlsx) files for indexing. But, I found that Tika juxtaposes cells on output. The example worksheets are in the attached .zip file.
I took the time to run Apache POI and it does not have this bug i.e. cells are properly separated.

When I run

-begin-
java -jar tika-0.3-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar --text no_cell_separators_when_extracted.xls
-end-

I get the following output:

-begin-
Plan1
    NameEmailSanta Claussanta@claus.org
    Tooth Fairytooth@fairy.org
-end-

Same thing with a .xlxs file:
-begin-
java -jar tika-0.3-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar --text no_cell_separators_when_extracted.xlsx
-end-

The output is:

-begin-
[Content_Types].xml



_rels/.rels

xl/workbook.xml



xl/theme/theme1.xml



xl/worksheets/_rels/sheet1.xml.rels

docProps/app.xml

-end-

Also note that the values from docProps/app.xml have been juxtaposed as well.

This way, after indexing these files using the output from Tika, a search engine will only find "Fairy" when substring matching is used, because "Tooth Fairy" becomes "Tooth Fairytooth@fairy.org". This is suboptimal and wrong.

Thanks for your attention. Best regards,
