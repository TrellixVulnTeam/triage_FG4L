The currently used com.googlecode.mp4parser:isoparser version is 1.0-RC-1. According to https://code.google.com/p/mp4parser/#Changes/Releases and https://code.google.com/p/mp4parser/source/list there have been quite some improvements since then. Before tackling more metadata (such as in TIKA-852) we should update to 1.0.2.
