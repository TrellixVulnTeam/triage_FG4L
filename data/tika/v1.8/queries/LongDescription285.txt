The MIME type database included in the Apache HTTP Server is one of the more complete and accurate media type and file extension resources out there.

Their magic byte settings don't seem to be as complete as the ones in Tika, but it would be good to check also those settings for extra information.

... and we should contribute any of the recent Tika settings back to httpd where they don't already know of those details.
