Some http-equiv meta tags in HTML documents have charset attributes that currently aren't handled properly.

For example, <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8; charset=UTF-8">

Or where content="text/html;; charset="utf-8" (note double semi-colons)

The parsing code needs to be more flexible to handle these edge cases.
