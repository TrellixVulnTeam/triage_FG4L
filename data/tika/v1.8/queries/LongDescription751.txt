I noticed some minor things in this method:


	It does too much work (writes the tmpFile out) if the
    EmbeddedDocumentExtractor didn't want to actually parse file
    file.




	It writes the tmpFile when it won't use it in the OLE10_NATIVE
    case (because we use a TikeInputStream from the in-RAM byte[]
    instead).



Also I fixed a typo in the method name (embeded -> embedded) â€“ is
that OK?  It's a protected method, and a few of the office parsers
invoke it.

Finally I cutover to TemporaryResources to track the possible tmpFile
and open TikaInputStream against it.

Separately, it's inefficient now that we must serialize a sub-dir
(DirectoryEntry) in the NPOIFileSystem to a tmp file only to re-parse
it back to an NPOIFileSystem in OfficeParser; I'd like to look into
instead (somehow) directly passing the NPOIFileSystem's DirectoryEntry
to OfficeParser... but that looks like a bigger change.
