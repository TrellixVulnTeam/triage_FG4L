RTF parser uses javax.swing.text.rtf, but it sucks.

It doesn't support '\ansicpg' tag (cite from RTF file format specification:
"This keyword represents the default ANSI code page used to perform the Unicode to ANSI conversion when writing RTF text").

Unfortunately Windows WordPad saves nonascii characters using \ansicpg instead of supported by javax.swing.text.rtf unicode characters.
