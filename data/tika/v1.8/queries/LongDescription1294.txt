TIKA-1268 added the capability to extract embedded images as regular embedded resources...a great feature!

However, for some use cases, it might not be desirable to extract those types of embedded resources.  I see two ways of allowing the client to choose whether or not to extract those images:

1) set a value in the metadata for the extracted images that identifies them as embedded PDXObjectImages vs regular image attachments.  The client can then choose not to process embedded resources with a given metadata value.

2) allow the client to set a parameter in the PDFConfig object.

My initial proposal is to go with option 2, and I'll attach a patch shortly.
