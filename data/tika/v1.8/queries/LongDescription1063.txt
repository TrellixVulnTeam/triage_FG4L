I've added basic support for list and text styles. Paragraph styles are omitted on purpose â€“ one could use the style names as class names, though.

Only bold, italic, and underlined text is supported.

Lists now differentiate between ordered and unordered lists.

Test case included. I've also changed the ODFParserTest to make a bit more use of the methods of its super class.
