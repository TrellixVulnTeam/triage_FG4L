I'd like to add proper integration tests for tika-bundle and expose the Tika facade object as a service so other bundles could access it easily like this:

    @Reference
    private Tika tika;

It would also be nice to allow other OSGi bundles to expose their Parser implementations as pluggable services and have the Tika bundle automatically pick up and use them along with all the embedded parsers it contains.
