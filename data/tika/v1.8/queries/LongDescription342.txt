Based on discussions in TIKA-340 I have improved the Bundle plugin configuration as follows:


	Tika Parsers and TIka Core are now embedded
         -> solution is to use a new configuration element <_exportcontents>, which just exports
	xmlbeans is now also embedded
         -> solution is to explicitly import org.w3c.dom, thus ignoring the embedded package
