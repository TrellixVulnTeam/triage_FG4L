If you try to use AutoDetectParser to handle an iWork document, it'll fail with:
 org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; lineNumber: 1; columnNumber: 1; Content is not allowed in prolog.
	at com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.util.ErrorHandlerWrapper.createSAXParseException(ErrorHandlerWrapper.java:198)

However IWorkPackageParser works fine. It seems the IWorkParser needs just the individual zip part, but is registered as the handler for the individual mime types, so breaks.
