As mentioned on the list a few weeks back, I've now finished getting an Ogg Vorbis and FLAC parser working. The code is available at https://github.com/Gagravarr/VorbisJava

As I see it, there are three options for getting it into Tika:

	Roll a release of the whole project from GitHub, upload jars to Maven Central, and add a parser pom dependency
	Bring the parser code over to Tika, and release (+post to Central) just the core jar
	Bring the whole lot over to Apache (maybe to Tika, maybe elsewhere?)



This issue is to track the plan, and the inclusion of the parsers into Tika one way or another
