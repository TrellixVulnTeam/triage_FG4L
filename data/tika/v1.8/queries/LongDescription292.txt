PDFBox 0.8 logs INFO messages for all PDF primitives that are not enabled in the respective PDFBox configuration. Many of these primitives are explicitly not needed for text extraction, so there's no point in logging so much about them.

Until this is fixed in PDFBox, we should work around it in Tika.
