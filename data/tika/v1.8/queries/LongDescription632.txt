I spotted this while working on TIKA-631 - an RTF file containing links has the link skipped over - neither the link text nor the link href are output.

In the attached sample file (which is the RTF contents of /test-documents/test-outlook2003.msg), we should see things like:

[a href="http://r.office.microsoft.com/r/rlidOutlookWelcomeMail1?clid=1033">Streamlined Mail Experience[/a> - Outlook

Instead, all we get is " - Outlook"
