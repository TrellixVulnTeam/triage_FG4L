The parsers for Microsoft file formats (word, excel, powerpoint) are structured as a Parser class that instantiates and invokes an Extractor class for the actual parsing. Now that the extra responsibilitites of the Parser interface have been refactored out there's no longer a need for such duality and we can merge the Extractor functionality to the Parser classes.
