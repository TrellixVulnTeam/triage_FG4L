The Tika.detect(InputStream) method returns "text/plain" for AR archives created with the Linux "Create Archive" option of Nautilus (available via right-clicking on a file).

The Apache Commons Compress "autodetection" code of the ArchiveStreamFactory looks at the first 12 bytes of the stream and correctly identifies the type as AR.
