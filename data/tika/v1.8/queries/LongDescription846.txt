Should be able to parse RDF bag elements as multi-valued metadata fields, i.e:
 <IPTC:Contact>
  <rdf:Bag>
   <rdf:li>Ray</rdf:li>
   <rdf:li>Gavin</rdf:li>
  </rdf:Bag>
 </IPTC:Contact>

Unfortunately in some libraries and command lines a single value in that same value may be presented as:
 <IPTC:Contact>Ray</IPTC:Contact>

ElementMetadataHandler should have a constructor which accepts a metadata Property in addition to the constructor which accepts a metadata name and be able to parse either format above if that Property.PropertyType is a bag.
