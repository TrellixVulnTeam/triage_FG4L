At the moment, some of the OOXML parsers set a content type, and others don't. Those that do always set the base type, no matter the contents

Instead, the detection logic should be re-used where possible within the parsers, with overriding only needed for things like protected files

(Once fixed, a few parts of the ooxml tests around types that are currently commented out can be re-enabled)
