As discussed in TIKA-443, we should have a new Geographic namespace. Initially, this will hold just:

	LATITUDE = geo:latitude
	LONGITUDE = geo:longitude



Later we can add things like height, bearing etc as required

This namespace will be used by both the geographic formats, as well as things like JPEG (exif geo tags) and HTML (icbm geo tags)
