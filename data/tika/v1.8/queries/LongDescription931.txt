In working on PDFBOX-1297, I realized Tika's PDFParser also doesn't
visit documents embedded with a PDF document (ie a PDF package).

Tika can actually handle this better than ExtractText since it can
recurse on any embedded document type (not just PDFs) and parse them
as well, vs ExtractText which only extracts when the embedded
documents are also PDF.

[Update: Moving this issue to Tika.]
