Attempting to open the testPPT.potm file found in the parsers' test-documents folder in a latest build of Tika will result in a TikaException, itself 'Caused by: org.apache.xmlbeans.XmlException: error: The document is not a presentation@http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/presentationml/2006/main: document element namespace mismatch expected "http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/presentationml/2006/main" got "http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/presentationml/2006/3/main"'.  I opened this file in MS Office 2007, and it said that it was a file created with a beta version of Office, and that it would be updated the next time it was saved to a more up-to-date format.  I made the contents look like that of the other Office 2007 presentation documents in the test-documents folder, and added this file and its mime type to the OOXMLParserTest class, and then had no problems with the .potm file. I'll attach a patch shortly.
