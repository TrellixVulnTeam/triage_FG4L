I get the following error parsing a html file containing a partial HTML document.  

TIKA-237: Illegal SAXException from org.apache.tika.parser.xml.DcXMLParser@3a43af 

The following conditions need to exist in the file for the error to be thrown:

+ A HTML comment before any HTML tags
+ More than one top level HTML tag

I will attach a test file to reproduce
