TaggedIOException can contain tags. It's used to contain TaggedInputStream which isn't serializable.

This can cause the ForkServer to fail when trying to report issues. See TIKA-827

2 solutions

	make the tag transient
	replace the InputStream instance in the tag by a serializable object specific to the input stream.



I opt for the first one as I really don't think we need more complexity
