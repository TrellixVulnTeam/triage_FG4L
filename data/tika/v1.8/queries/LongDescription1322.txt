Tika parses XML input using org.apache.tika.parser.xml.XMLParser. XMLParser opens a "p" tag before a SAXParser's output of the input XML is appended. A possible SAXException during parsing is rethrown but the opened "p" tag not closed. The Zip bomb detection in SecureContentHandler relies on consistent starting and closing of elements. With the current behaviour of XMLParser it will be triggered, for example, if an archive contains 10 (SecureContentHandler#maxPackageEntryDepth) invalid XML files.
