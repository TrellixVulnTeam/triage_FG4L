Currently we edit the list of supported types (http://lucene.apache.org/tika/0.7/formats.html) manually, which is bound to leave the list outdated and incomplete. It would be better if the list was automatically generated from the tika-mimetypes.xml file and the getSupportedTypes() response of the AutoDetectParser class.
