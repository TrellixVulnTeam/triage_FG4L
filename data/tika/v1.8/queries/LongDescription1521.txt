While working on TIKA-1028, I notice that while Commons Compress doesn't currently handle decrypting password protected zip files, it does handle password protected 7zip files

We should therefore add logic into the package parser to spot password protected 7zip files, and fetch the password for them from a PasswordProvider if given
