I used Tika inside application, that should run as MS Windows service via Apache Commons Daemon - procrun (http://commons.apache.org/daemon/procrun.html). When it was running under procrun, then Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() returned null instead ClassLoader's instance. I made a workaround in my app by explicitly setting classloader for current thread.  I'll attach fix, that should use system class loader if getContextClassLoader will return null
