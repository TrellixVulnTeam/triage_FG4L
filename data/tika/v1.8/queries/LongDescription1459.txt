Small bug in BasicContentHandlerFactory that does not properly set write limit to -1 when creating a BodyContentHandler.  The result is that BodyContentHandler falls back to default of 100k.  

Thank you, Tilman Hausherr, for your collaboration, without which I wouldn't have found this for a good while!
