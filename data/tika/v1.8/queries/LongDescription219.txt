As discussed recently on the mailing list [1], it would be good to split Tika to components based on use cases and external dependencies.

The proposed split is:


	tika-core - core parts of Tika; everything but cli, gui, and the parser.* packages
	tika-parsers - format-specific parser classes; with dependencies to external libraries
	tika-app - depends on all of the above; adds cli and gui; standalone jar packaging
