We should create an interface similar to ExternalParser which can use a command line/external Translator. This will be a good step toward machine translation and removing dependence on an internet-based translation API.

I imagine this will overlap a bit with ExternalParser. So, later down the line, maybe we can somehow combine the two with a common interface/super class. For now, I am going to work on getting a Moses or Joshua translator (related to TIKA-1343) working.
