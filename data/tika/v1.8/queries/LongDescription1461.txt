Given this "ordinary" Java JAR file
https://maven.atlassian.com/content/groups/public/com/atlassian/support/healthcheck/support-healthcheck-plugin/1.0.3/support-healthcheck-plugin-1.0.3.jar

Manually inspected and tested it, it is a Jar file and is valid one.

Still, Tika Core's Detector detects it as type application/x-msdownload; format=pe. Tthe detection is "hinted" with file name, hence "jar" hint is present, still it's not detected as desired application/java-archive.

IMO, this happens due to the problem with priority of application/x-msdownload; format=pe, which is 55. If it would be 50, the "mediation" would kick in, see TIKA-1292. 

Changing/overriding magic priority is not possible using custom-mimetypes.xml is also not possible.

Unsure what the correct solution is here, nor how to circumvent this without patching Tika.

The problem affects versions 1.5 but also 1.6, but we target 1.6.
