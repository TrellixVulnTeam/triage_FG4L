I have to extract content from encrypted PDFs. Setting the PDF password using the TIKA_PASSWORD environment variable works, however it only allows for one PDF password.

It would be very useful to be able to pass the password in during the HTTP request - as a header or by some other means. This way I can run a central JAXRS server and extract content from all PDFs, rather than a separate server for each department/group that has its own password.
