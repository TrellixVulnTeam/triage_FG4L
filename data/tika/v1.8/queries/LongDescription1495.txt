Following on from TIKA-1491, it would be good to also have a parser for BPG files as well. Likely this would pull out some very basic metadata from the header, then locate the EXIF and XMP blocks + hand those on for parsing

There doesn't appear to be a suitable Java library yet, but based on reading the file format spec at http://bellard.org/bpg/bpg_spec.txt it doesn't look like a basic parser would be that much work!
