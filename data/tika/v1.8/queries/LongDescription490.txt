Currently the Tika LanguageIdentifier loads language profiles thorugh a hardcoded static block in the java code.

It would be better to make this configurable, so you could add your own languages without recompiling.

Suggested approach:
Remove the static code block loading all languages. Instead look for a tika.languageidentification.properties file on classpath.
Now the user can simply make his/her own (additional) language profile files, put them on the classpath together with a properties file and off you go!

Also, once you make it configurable, there might be an issue of having the profiles as static members, as you will force the same behaviour for the whole VM. A static Map of Maps could solve this.
