Using the CLI tool on plain-text file and outputting metadata.
The "Content-Language:" is output based on encoding based language estimate. But it is not reliable as it does not detect anything for UTF-8 and detects english for ISO-8859-1.

We already dropped encoding-based language estimates from the HTML

Chris, Paul and Ingo already +1'ed this on the mailing list.

PS: I think it is unclear that "Content-Language" is not based on the LanguageIdentifier feature. Would make sense to clarify this. However, there's another issue filed to enable true language identification from CLI as well, which would fill this gap.
