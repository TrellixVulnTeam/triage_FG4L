Following on from TIKA-86, we would like to add support for regular expressions to the MagicDetector. This would allow more signatures to be re-used from more sources (e.g. the file(1) command). As part of the SCAPE Project, we have added this functionality to our own Tika branch (e.g. https://github.com/openplanets/tika/commit/b8de9e77c8b432788e3f73a4dbccca8ea044b503) and are working to tidy this up to make a clean patch we can submit here.

BTW, are there any patch submission guidelines or coding standards we should check our work against first?
