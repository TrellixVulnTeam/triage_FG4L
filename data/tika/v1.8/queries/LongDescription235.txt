For a number of years now, the Lucene community has been criticized for not eating our own "dog food" when it comes to search. My company has built and hosts a site search (http://search.lucidimagination.com/) that is powered by Apache Solr and Lucene and we'd like to donate it's use to the Lucene community. Additionally, it allows one to search all of the Tika content from a single place, including web, wiki, JIRA and mail archives.

A sample of what it might look like is at http://people.apache.org/~gsingers/tika/    Note, however, I am not entirely sure how Tika deploys just yet, so there are a few issues w/ the display

Lucid has a fault tolerant setup with replication and fail over as well as monitoring services in place. We are committed to maintaining and expanding the search capabilities on the site.

The following patch adds the basics to Tika to support the search, but isn't entirely done yet b/c I'm not sure what the Look and Feel Tika wants.
