Currently, the PDF Parser does   calendar.getTime().toString()   which means dates end up in your local timezone, and are hard to parse

The Open Document parsers output in iso 8601 format, which avoids these two problems

The poi ole2 based parsers also output in date.toString() format, with the same timezone/parsing problems

We should probably select one format, and update the parsers to all output in it
