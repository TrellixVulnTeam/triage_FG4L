It would be good to have a mechanism that automatically detects a "zip bomb", i.e. a compressed document that expands to excessive amounts of extracted text. The classic example is the 42.zip file that's just 42kB in size, but expands to about 4 petabytes when all layers are fully uncompressed.

A simple preventive measure could be a Parser decorator that counts the number of input bytes and the output characters, and fails with a TikaException when the ratio exceeds some configurable limit.

As another preventive measure, the decorator could also keep track of the time (and perhaps even memory, if possible) it takes to process the input document. A TikaException would be thrown if processing time exceeds some configurable limit.
