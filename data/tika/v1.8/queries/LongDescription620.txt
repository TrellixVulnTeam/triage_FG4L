As discovered though TIKA-555, we weren't correctly handling the case of non canonical mimetypes properly

There are three bits to this:

	The default parser as created by TikaConfig.getDefaultConfig() needs the full mime registry passing in automatically, so it can walk the mime tree. Fixed in r1084801
	The Composite Parser needs to handle child parsers that declare they support an alias rather than the canonical mimetype. Initial fix in r1084798, Jukka has an idea for a cleaner way
	When Composite Parser looks for a parser for a mime type, it'll need to canonicalise this before checking. (this isn't a problem for the Auto Detect parser, but can be for others)



We also probably need a couple more unit tests for this, as TIKA-555 had broken auto detect parsing of bmp (though not direct ImageParser), though none of our tests noticed...
