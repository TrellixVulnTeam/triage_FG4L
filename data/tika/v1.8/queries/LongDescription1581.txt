jhighlight jar is a Tika dependency.  The Lucene team discovered that, while it claims to be a CDDL/LGPL dual-license, some of its functionality is LGPL only:



Solr's contrib/extraction contains jhighlight-1.0.jar which declares itself as dual CDDL or LGPL license. However, some of its classes are distributed only under LGPL, e.g.

com.uwyn.jhighlight.highlighter.
  CppHighlighter.java
  GroovyHighlighter.java
  JavaHighlighter.java
  XmlHighlighter.java

I downloaded the sources from Maven (http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/uwyn/jhighlight/1.0/jhighlight-1.0-sources.jar) to confirm that, and also found this SVN repo: http://svn.rifers.org/jhighlight/tags/release-1.0, though the project's website seems to not exist anymore (https://jhighlight.dev.java.net/).

I didn't find any direct usage of it in our code, so I guess it's probably needed by a 3rd party dependency, such as Tika. Therefore if we e.g. omit it, things will compile, but may fail at runtime.



Is it possible to remove this dependency for future releases, or allow only optional inclusion of this package?  It is of concern to the ManifoldCF project because we distribute a binary package that includes Tika and its required dependencies, which currently includes jHighlight.
