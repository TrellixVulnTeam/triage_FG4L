Many thanks to Lewis John McGibbney for TIKA-1301!  Once we get nightly builds up and running again, it might be fun to run Tika regularly against a large set of docs and report metrics.

One excellent candidate corpus is govdocs1: http://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/files.

Any other candidate corpora?  
William Palmer, have anything handy you'd like to contribute?
