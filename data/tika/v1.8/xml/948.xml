                    <description>&lt;p&gt;This is just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-704&quot; title=&quot;PDF and Outlook docs embedded in MS Word documents not parsed&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;TIKA-704&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;TIKA-704&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, except that issue was for an OOXML Word&lt;br/&gt;
doc but this is for the older Word 97-2003 format.&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="13406172" author="mikemccand" created="Wed, 4 Jul 2012 00:38:40 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s a trivial test document + test case showing the issue; if you run TikaCLI&lt;br/&gt;
-z on this you&apos;ll get an embedded file extracted as _1402837031.wps,&lt;br/&gt;
but that really should be a PDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I traced this down a bit, into AbstractPOIFSExtractor, where it calls&lt;br/&gt;
POIFSDocumentType.detectType(dir) and that (incorrectly) returns WPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the logic in POIFSContainerDetector.detect (which guesses the&lt;br/&gt;
embedded file&apos;s type by looking at the directory listing of the&lt;br/&gt;
document node) is too simplistic?  We may need to peek into the&lt;br/&gt;
\0001CompObj contents to get the true document type (I can see, using&lt;br/&gt;
POI&apos;s POIFSViewer that this seems to identify the MediaType of the&lt;br/&gt;
file, and processStarDrawOrImpress already does so...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don&apos;t know the format of the bytes in \0001CompObj.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe alternatively ... we can pull the CONTENTS bytes and&lt;br/&gt;
auto-detect on that.  Basically we somehow need to determine if it&apos;s&lt;br/&gt;
another office format (and do what we now do) else pull the CONTENTS&lt;br/&gt;
bytes and recurse on only that.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I fixed POIFSContainerDetector to also look for PDF, by loading the&lt;br/&gt;
CompObj bytes if present (I refactored the Star Impress/Draw code that&lt;br/&gt;
was already doing so), and fixed AbstractPOIFSExtractor to handle&lt;br/&gt;
non-office embedded documents (well, only PDF for now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would good to fix all other non-office document types&lt;br/&gt;
that may be embedded ... but I think we can do that in future issue(s).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="13408180" author="alexott" created="Fri, 6 Jul 2012 18:48:32 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Maybe you also reuse information from prop stream nearby of CompObj?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Format of CompObj is described in MS&apos;s documentation, as I remember, there are 2 flavors of them, with different offsets of actual data&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13408300" author="gagravarr" created="Fri, 6 Jul 2012 21:42:09 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve had a go at fixing this in r1358404, using a slightly different method. Michael&apos;s suggested fix didn&apos;t seem to scale well to additional formats, and would&apos;ve been a bit confusing for the extractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I&apos;ve updated POIFSContainerDetector to report that a CompObj that isn&apos;t a known &quot;native CompObj&quot; has been found (older Works file, some older Star files etc are all natively stored). This is reported in a similar way to the OLE10Native stuff, which was slightly tweaked. I&apos;ve then updated the AbstarctPOIFSExtractor to then pull the data out of the CompObj structure. Tika-App -z is then able to correctly extract the pdf out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One remaining issue is with file extensions, a little bit more work is needed to do that cleanly I think&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13408436" author="gagravarr" created="Sat, 7 Jul 2012 00:13:56 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;I think r1358467 should fix the file extension problem in a general way for all (known) file formats. The only thing is we don&apos;t currently make use of things like &quot;Adobe Acrobat&quot; in the CompObj to short-cut the detection, it&apos;s done in a general way for all formats known or unknown. Not sure if we need to fix this or not though&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13409002" author="mikemccand" created="Sun, 8 Jul 2012 19:08:38 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking this Nick!  Can you add a CHANGES entry for it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems odd not using the explicitly declared file type inside the CompObj and running detection on the byte[] CONTENTS instead, but it is definitely better than my original patch since it can handle all formats we can detect (not just PDF), so +1.  We can separately (later) decode CompObj if that ever seems necessary...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also: do we have any test data for that Quill96 (that I almost broke!)?  Would be nice to have test coverage for it...&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13409024" author="gagravarr" created="Sun, 8 Jul 2012 19:57:53 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;If someone feels keen, we could add CompObj decoding. When that&apos;s there, we could try to extract helpful data (such as file type) out. However, it doesn&apos;t look like it stores the file type as such, just the application the data should be passed to, which might well not be specific enough&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quill96 thing comes from an old works file, from an old bug report somewhere. IIRC we didn&apos;t get a sample file to go with it, but it might be good for someone to work out which mailing list discussion / old issue it&apos;s associated with to check...&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13409094" author="mikemccand" created="Sun, 8 Jul 2012 23:48:47 +0100"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it doesn&apos;t look like it stores the file type as such, just the application the data should be passed to, which might well not be specific enough&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahh, that&apos;s a good point...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh in fact it looks like we do have test coverage for this (TestContainerAwareDetector.testDetectOLE2), so all is good.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
