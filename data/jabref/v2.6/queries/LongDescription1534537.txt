A usability issue: By pressing the down arrow (bottom left corner, groups interface) one too many times, I managed to vertically enlarge the groups interface until the up/down resize arrows were out of sight. In this state there was no obvious way to resize it back. If the search window is initiated, it is then rendered out-of-window and is hence invisible. I suggest changing the groups interface so that it resizes by dragging the bottom border. Also if the groups interface is open, and another interface is launched, the groups interface should auto-resize as necessary to fit the new interface in-window. best regards, -J
