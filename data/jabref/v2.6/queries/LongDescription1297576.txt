Sending the content of the entry preview to a printer (simple File->Print) would be cool. Customizing the preview allows to have notes or comments displayed and nicely formated. But printing out this information is not easily possible (copy-paste of the entry preview can be a solution, but depending on the target programm may fail to preserve text formating).
