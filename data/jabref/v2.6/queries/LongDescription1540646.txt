Hello! I'm referring to JabRef 2.1. I prefer to sort the entries by default according to the bibtexkey, and I would also prefer the entries to be saved in the file ordered by the bibxtexkey. Unfortunately, Options -> Preferences -> Entry table -> Primary sort criterion does not offer "bibtexkey". It would be nice to add it, if possible. I should tell that I've found a workaround: as the bibtexkey is the internal fourth sort criterion, I've simply used three unused field for the first three criteria. However, I suppose this is not really the best idea...
