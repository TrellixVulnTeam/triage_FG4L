Hello, I posted the message below recently and Christopher suggested to add the problem to the bug database. So here it is. I'm using jabref 2.3b. My bibtexkeys are auto-generated by the pattern [author]_[year]. If some key already exists, jabref automatically adds letters after the key. miller_2000 miller_2000a miller_2000b, and so on. If I want to do autolinking of the correspondingly named pdf or ppt files, jabref includes all the files in the miller_2000 file-field. Thus the file field of miller_2000 contains: miller_2000.pdf, miller_2000a.pdf, miller_2000b.pdf, In the documentation I saw, that jabref searches for all files that "inlcude" the bibtexkey. How can I limit this to an exact match. I can not remember that I had the problem in previous versions. I guess this is possble by setting the correct regular expression? Regular expressions are quite cryptic to me. Also manual pages on regexs did not help. Any suggestions for a proper regex? Thanks, Heiko RE: auto-linking - regex By: Christopher Oezbek (coezbek) - 2007-08-17 07:53 Hi Heiko, in 2.3b a new implementation was written for the synchronize files behavior which is causing your problem and there is no workaround for this as far as I can see. Can you enter this as a bug into the Bug database? Include in your comment the following: >>> The culprit for this can be found in Util.findAssociatedFiles which only checks whether the bibtex-key is contained in the filename. <<< Thanks, Christopher
