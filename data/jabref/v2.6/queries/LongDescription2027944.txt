When the path of a customized export filter is changed, this is not always taken into account... 1) copy an export filter in a directory (such as "dummy1") 2) configure this export filter in JabRef (options --> manage customized export filters) 3) export a database using this filter 3) rename the directory containing the filter (such as "dummy2") 4) reconfigure the export filter to account for the new directory name 5) export the database ==> a message is displayed, saying the file could not be exported because the filter could not be found. The filter's directory displayed in the message is "dummy1", and not "dummy2". (but the "configuration of export filter " window shows "dummy2". Bug found in 2.3.1, but also when compiled from source (on July 24, 2008)
