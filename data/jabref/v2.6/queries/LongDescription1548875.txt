After reconfiguring my bibtex key generator to incorporate the first word of the title, the download pdf function now fails because it attempts to create filenames based on the bibtex key. Because the title's first word might contain a character such as ':' (this gets incorporated into the key), the filename is unsupported and the pdf does not get saved. Solution: Based on the platform, remove or translate unsupported filename charaters in the bibtex key before automatically creating the filename and saving the file.
