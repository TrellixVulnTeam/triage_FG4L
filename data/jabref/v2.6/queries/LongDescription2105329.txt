I am not sure if this is a bug or a feature: If I add a new entry via the "+" button, the view of the main window used to get updated, showing me the position of the new entry in the entry list. This "jumping" to the position of the new entry doesn't happen anymore and one has to scroll to find the new entry in the database. If this is a feature, where is the feat? And if it's a bug, please correct it for the next version. Oliver P.S.: Thanks for the great work, the Jabref is marvellous!
