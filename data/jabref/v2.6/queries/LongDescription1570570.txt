A minor addition which would aid usability. Upon importing a reference list into the database the suspected duplicates are detected and displayed on the screen. In addition to the "deselect all" and "select all" buttons it would be useful to have an additional button "deselect all duplicates", to save manually having to unclick each suspected duplicate,which can be quite cumbersome if you are importing 100 references of which 50 are duplicates.
