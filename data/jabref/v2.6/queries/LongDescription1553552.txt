In version 2.1 of JabRef any changes made to a bibtex field via the interface are not being recognised as changes until the user switches to another field. This may not be a big deal for small fields like "bibtexkey" or "author" but for the larger fields like "review" or "annote" there's the potential for a lot of work to be lost. Since JabRef doesn't recognize that any changes were made the user has to actually deliberately change to a different field before any save operations; if you don't change fields but still hit save then quit, you've just lost all changes you made to that last field. It's particularly bad if, like me, you're used to emacs keybindings and hit ^w (close database in JabRef) to initiate a copy & paste half way through writing a lengthy review.
