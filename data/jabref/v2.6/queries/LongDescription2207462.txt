When searching for a string with the "Web Search > Search ACM Digital Library" function, the following happens (e.g. searching "sql injection" in The Guide): * A new window opens with progress bar where the results will later be shown (yet empty). * The new window disappears (behind the main JabRef window) and a message box opens: "444 entries found. To reduce server load, only 50 will be downloaded." * Hitting ok: Message box closes, but the result window stays in the background (invisible). One needs to move the JabRef window to find the results. I would expect that the focus moves to the results window again. Version info: JabRef 2.4.1 and also SVN trunk (on Windows)
