I noticed that the bib file saved by JabRef has line breaks in long lines. This is no problem, but causes a slight bug when referencing BibTeX strings. If the line is broken right after a constant part of the string, this part may not have a space after it. In my case, I use strings for author names and when my author field for an entry becomes too long. In JabRef, I type in the author field: #JaneDoe# and #JohnDoe# and #JPMorgan# and #FooBar# The exported string looks like this: author = JaneDoe # { and } # JohnDoe # { and } # JPMorgan # { and} # FooBar, Notice how the last "and" has no space (should s/{ and}/{ and }/). This results in a concatonation for BibTeX that reads "andContentsOfFooBarString" as opposed to the correct "and ContentsOfFooBarString". I hope this is somewhat understandable.
