I use JabRef 2.0.1 on Windows98 SE with Java JRE 5.0 and Adobe Reader 6.0. Everything works fine exept that I cannot view pdf-Files. Clicking on the pdf-icon has no effect. The status line says "viewer called" or something like that but nothing happens. I assume it has something to do with the hardcoding of "cmd.exe" in Util.java (which should probably be "command.com" for Win98). Unfortunately I cant help myself. Thanks a lot for your help! JabRef is a great tool!
