When using the AUTO facility to link to a pdf the link string returned in the `Pdf' field (under the `General' tab) is missing the first character of the subdirectory name. The `Options > Preferences > Use regular expression' is ticked and set to the default `**/.*[bibtexkey].*\\.[extension]' The `Options > Preferences > Main PDF Dir' is set to: `D:\' The target PDF file is: `D:\myDir\myRef2002.pdf' But the link set by the auto facility is: `yDir\myRef2002.pdf' Any ideas anyone?
