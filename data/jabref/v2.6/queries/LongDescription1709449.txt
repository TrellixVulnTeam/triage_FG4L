Hi there! I have a document with an DOI and an hyperlink. JabRef (2.2) shows in the document list the hyperlink icon and offers on a right click to this icon the hyperlink icon and the DOI icon in a context menu (very nice!). Now: Clicking the DOI icon fails, since the default DOI server is not prepended, i.e. Firefox says --- cut --- The requested URL could not be retrieved While trying to retrieve the URL: http://10.1109/49.622908 --- cut --- cheers Bernd p.s. A suggestion: You should use a 3rd icon in the document list if both, the hyperlink and the DOI, are available to show this to the user. Otherwise I have to remember/guess that I saved an DOI and an hyperlink for this document.
