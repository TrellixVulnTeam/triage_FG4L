I'd like to be able to generate bibtex keys as follows: - Use [auth:lower], if an author is specified. - Otherwise, use [edtr:lower]. This way I'd always have some sensible name on Bibtex keys. Usually one has specified only the author or the editor, not both. Thus, using something like "[auth:lower][edtr:lower]" would do what I want in most cases. However, there is at least one notable exception: "inbook" entries. Those usually contain the author of the chapter in the "author" field, and the editor of the book in the "editor" field. Naturally, I'd like to have just the name of the author in the bibtex key. Thus, would it be possible to have something like [auth-or-edtr] which would prefer using the author and would use editor only if the author is missing? --- A related issue: It would be nice if one could show "author or editor" in one column in the entry table, too. Having two columns would be waste of screen space. Also, it would be nice to have "journal or booktitle" for the same reason. Usually only one of those fields applies.
