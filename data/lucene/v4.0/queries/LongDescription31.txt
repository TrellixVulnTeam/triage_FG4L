static boolean LINUX - True iff running on Windows. 

Are you sure about this one??? :o)

And, yes, 'iff' should be spelled 'if' (check the other descriptions for the 
same typo).

Maybe this set of booleans should instead be a set of integers, because since 
they are mutually exclusive... and they could be used in the 'switch' block too!
