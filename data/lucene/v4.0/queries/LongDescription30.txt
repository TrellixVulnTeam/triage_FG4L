I run a loop on documents to discover what fields are searchable.  
UnStored fields return false when I call isIndexed().  Converting these 
fields to Text fields in the indexer corrects the problems.

Obviously, using Text fields is a workaround, but I think the behaviour is 
incorrect.

I've reproduced the issue on MacOS X and Linux.  I'm using rc4.
