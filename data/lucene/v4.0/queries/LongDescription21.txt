When a query with an OR contains a clause that results in 0, lucene returns 0 
hits even if the other clause returned matches. For example, the search 
expression: 
freedent OR trident 
returns 0 matches. However just searching on freedent returns several matches. 
Searching on trident returns 0 matches.
