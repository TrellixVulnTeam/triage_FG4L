I've created an index of UTF-8 encoded documents and making sure that all
queries are converted to UTF-8. When searching the index with query containing
non-ascii UTF-8 characters and an asterisk, no results are found even though
there are documents that contain the query word. Searching does work when query
doesn't contain non-ascii UTF-8 characters or without asterisk works always.
Test results with swedish words:
"fÃ¶dde" - works ok, returns documents.
"fÃ¶dd*" - doesn't return any results.
"fÃ¶dd" - works ok, returns documents.
"kom*" - works ok, returns documents.
