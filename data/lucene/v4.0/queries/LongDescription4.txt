The TermQuery allows .setBost to set a float multiplier.  The boost is entered 
via a '^'<NUMBER> format in the String query, however, while .setBoost will 
take a negative number, the parser does not allow negative numbers due to the 
limited description of the <NUMBER> token (QueryParser.jj):



 <NUMBER:     (<_NUM_CHAR>)+ "." (<_NUM_CHAR>)+ >




The solution is to allow + or - as in:



 <NUMBER:    (["+","-"])? (<_NUM_CHAR>)+ "." (<_NUM_CHAR>)+ >




This works correctly, properly reading negative numbers.  

I have done some simple tests, and negative boost seems to work as expected, by 
moving the entry to the end of the list.
