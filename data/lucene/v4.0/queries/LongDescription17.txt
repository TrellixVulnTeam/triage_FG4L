While the input sources are abstracted, the indices are always files in the 
FileSystem.  It would be nice to abstract the IndexWriter to output to other 
data stores.

For example, I would like to trying to use Lucene to index and search a set of 
short-lived documents while involved in a P2P environment.  Ideally, this 
index (which would be single merge for each peer) can reside in memory rather 
than in the file system (for reasons of security as much as anything else â€“ 
I'd prefer not to require permission to write out to the user's filesystem).

I think it'd be a nice addition to Lucene.  It would make the Lucene engine 
more easily embedded into other apps.
