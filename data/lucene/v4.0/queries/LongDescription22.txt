This report is for Lucene 1.2 RC4.

When indexing a 4 MB size text file using the HTMLIndexer from the demo package 
I get the following error:

Parse Aborted: Lexical error at line 106377, column 64.  Encountered: "=" (61),
after : "".

The line actually contains nothing more than a lot of spaces followed by word, 
so nothing special.

If I delete the line, the error still occurs.
If I crop the file so that the file contains less than 106377 lines, the error 
still occurs.
If I crop the file further, at a certain point the error disappears.

The error does not occur when using the IndexFiles indexer.
