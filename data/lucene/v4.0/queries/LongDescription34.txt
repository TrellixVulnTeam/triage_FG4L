E-mail token in StandardTokenizer.jj does not match many valid e-mail 
addresses. See line 106: 

<EMAIL: <ALPHANUM> "@" <ALPHANUM> ("." <ALPHANUM>)+ > 

For example, neither danson@germane-software.com (because of the dash) nor 
dale.anson@germane-software.com (because of the first dot and the dash) match. 
the following is slightly better, but does not come close to meeting the 
specifications of RFC 822: 

<EMAIL: <ALPHANUM> ("."|"" <ALPHANUM>)+ "@" <ALPHANUM> ("."|"" <ALPHANUM>)+ 
> 

This is being reported against the May 11 nightly build (I compiled from 
source using the supplied Ant build file on RedHat Linux 7.2, jikes, javacc 
2.0, and Sun Linux JDK 1.4), however, I originally ran across this problem in 
Lucene 1.2 rc4.
