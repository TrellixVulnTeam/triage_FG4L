There is a problem when you try to create a directory (FSDirectory) that doesn't exists and you 
specified a path with a depth greater than 1.

For example: lucia/index/

The problem 
lays on the method
  private synchronized void create() throws IOException {
    if 
(!directory.exists())
      directory.mkdir();   <======== HERE SHOULD BE mkdirs();


String[] files = directory.list();            // clear old files
    for (int i = 0; i < files.length; i++) 
{
      
File file = new File(directory, files[i]);
      if (!file.delete())
        throw new 
IOException("couldn't delete " + files[i]);
    }
  }
