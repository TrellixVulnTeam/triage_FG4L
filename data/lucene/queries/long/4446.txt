This has baked for some time: no crazy fails in hudson or anything.

The code (in my opinion) is actually a lot simpler than the current postings format, its faster, the indexes are smaller, and so on.

We should probably spend some time just going over the code and adding some more tests and such but I think its time to start looking at cutting over.
