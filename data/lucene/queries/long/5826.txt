When ignoreCase=false, we should accept title-cased/upper-cased forms just like hunspell -m. Furthermore there are some options around this:

	LANG: can turn on alternate casing for turkish/azeri
	KEEPCASE: can prevent acceptance of title/upper cased forms for words



While we are here setting up the same logic anyway, add support for similar  options:

	NEEDAFFIX/PSEUDOROOT: form is invalid without being affixed
	ONLYINCOMPOUND: form/affixes only make sense inside compounds.



This stuff is unrelated to the ignoreCase=true option. If you use that option though, it does use correct alternate casing for tr_TR/az_AZ now though.

I didn't yet implement CHECKSHARPS because it seems more complicated, I have to figure out what the logic there should be first.
