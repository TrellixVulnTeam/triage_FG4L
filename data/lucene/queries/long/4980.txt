I tried to combine these two and there were several issues:


	It's ... really tricky to manage the two different
    FacetAccumulators across that N FacetCollectors that DrillSideways
    creates ... to fix this I added a new MultiFacetsAccumulator that
    switches for you.




	There was still one place in DS/DDQ that wasn't properly handling
    a non-Term drill-down.




	There was a bug in the "collector method" for DrillSideways
    whereby if a given segment had no hits, it was skipped, which is
    incorrect because it must still be visited to tally up the
    sideways counts.




	Separately I noticed that DrillSideways was doing too much work:
    it would count up drill-down counts and drill-sideways counts
    against the same dim (but then discard the drill-down counts in
    the end).
