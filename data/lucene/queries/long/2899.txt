Now that OpenNLP is an ASF project and has a nice license, it would be nice to have a submodule (under analysis) that exposed capabilities for it. Drew Farris, Tom Morton and I have code that does:

	Sentence Detection as a Tokenizer (could also be a TokenFilter, although it would have to change slightly to buffer tokens)
	NamedEntity recognition as a TokenFilter



We are also planning a Tokenizer/TokenFilter that can put parts of speech as either payloads (PartOfSpeechAttribute?) on a token or at the same position.

I'd propose it go under:
modules/analysis/opennlp
