Currently smokeTester (ant nightly-smoke) fails, because it invokes
this python script directly and the javadocs checker is more picky.

However, java6's javadocs generates hopelessly broken html.

We should fix it to only do this across the java7-generated javadocs and get smokeTesting passing again.
