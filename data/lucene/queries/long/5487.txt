This is just an exploratory patch ... still many nocommits, but I
think it may be promising.

I find the two booleans we pass to Weight.scorer confusing, because
they really only apply to whoever will call score(Collector) (just
IndexSearcher and BooleanScorer).

The params are pointless for the vast majority of scorers, because
very, very few query scorers really need to change how top-scoring is
done, and those scorers can only score top-level (throw throw UOE
from nextDoc/advance).  It seems like these two types of scorers
should be separately typed.
