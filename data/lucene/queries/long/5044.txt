The problem appears in version 4.3.0 and in revision 1490286.  I
attached a one-line patch that fixes it.

In method "AllGroupHeadsCollectorTest.arrayContains", the loop over
"actual" should break immediately after "found" is set to "true".  All
the iterations after "found" is set to "true" do not perform any
useful work, at best they just set "found" again to "true".

Method "processWord" in class "CapitalizationFilter" has a similar
loop (over "prefix"), and this loop breaks immediately after "match"
is set to "false", just like in the proposed patch.  Other methods
(e.g., "Step.apply", "JapaneseTokenizer.computePenalty",
"CompressingStoredFieldsWriter.saveInts", "FieldQuery.checkOverlap")
also have similar loops with similar breaks, just like in the proposed
patch.
