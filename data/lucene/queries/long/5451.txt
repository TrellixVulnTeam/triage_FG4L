A user reported a fairly serious issue affecting the latest version of Spatial4j 0.4

https://github.com/spatial4j/spatial4j/issues/72 "JtsSpatialContextFactory and geo=false with worldBounds fails"

I've already fixed this locally and I'll push out a bug-fix Spatial4j 0.4.1.  Upgrading will be a complete drop-in replacement.  Heck I could do that now but as I work with the user who found the bug I want to see if there's any other problem.
