IndexSearcher has 3 methods:


StoredDocument doc(int)
void doc(int, StoredFieldVisitor)
final StoredDocument document(int, Set<String>)



The last one is confusing for subclasses (e.g. SolrIndexSearcher) that override these methods. for example that one has its own StoredDocument doc(int, Set) method. 

But now this means a user could always call the wrong method (this final document() method) and get the wrong behavior (versus calling doc()).

I think the name is also wrong. it should be doc() like the others.
