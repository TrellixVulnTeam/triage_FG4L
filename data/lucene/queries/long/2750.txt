Kamikaze 3.0.1 is the updated version of Kamikaze 2.0.0. It can achieve significantly better performance then Kamikaze 2.0.0 in terms of both compressed size and decompression speed. The main difference between the two versions is Kamikaze 3.0.x uses the much more efficient implementation of the PForDelta compression algorithm. My goal is to integrate the highly efficient PForDelta implementation into Lucene Codec.
