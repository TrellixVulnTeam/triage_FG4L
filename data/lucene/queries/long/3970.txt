Like Robert Muir said in LUCENE-3109:
Also I think there are other improvements we can do here that would be more natural:
Fields.getUniqueFieldCount() -> Fields.size()
Terms.getUniqueTermCount() -> Terms.size()
I believe this dramatically improves understandability (way less 'scary', actually beautiful).
