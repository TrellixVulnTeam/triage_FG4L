Currently WordDelimiterFilter's constructor is:



public WordDelimiterFilter(TokenStream in,
	                             byte[] charTypeTable,
	                             int generateWordParts,
	                             int generateNumberParts,
	                             int catenateWords,
	                             int catenateNumbers,
	                             int catenateAll,
	                             int splitOnCaseChange,
	                             int preserveOriginal,
	                             int splitOnNumerics,
	                             int stemEnglishPossessive,
	                             CharArraySet protWords) {



which means its instantiation is an unreadable combination of 1s and 0s.  

We should improve this by either using a Builder, 'int flags' or an EnumSet.
