NullPointer Exceptions when searching on an index with a query that has a field that's not in the index.

The NullPointer is thrown at line 1141:

public DocValues normValues(String field) {
      if (fieldInfos.get(field).omitsNorms())  <---- //If fieldInfos doesn't contain the field then a NullPointer is thrown.
        return null;
