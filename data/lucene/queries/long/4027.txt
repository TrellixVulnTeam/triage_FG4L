Currently it uses the 4.0 impl..., worse the PreFlexRW writes with 4.0 impl too.

This is dangerous. we changed the format even to support offsets (though 3.x 
should be unaffacted by that), but just in general I don't even trust
that testbackwardscompatibility has big enough indexes to ever use any skipdata
to detect if we screw up.
