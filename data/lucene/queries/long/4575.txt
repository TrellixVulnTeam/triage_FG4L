Spinoff from here http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/commit-with-only-commitData-td4022155.html.

In some cases, it is valuable to be able to commit changes to the index, even if the changes are just commitData. Such data is sometimes used by applications to register in the index some global application information/state.

The proposal is:


	Add a setCommitData() API and separate it from commit() and prepareCommit() (simplify their API)




	When that API is called, flip on the dirty/changes bit, so that this gets committed even if no other changes were made to the index.



I will work on a patch a post.
