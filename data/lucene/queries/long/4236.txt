After LUCENE-3505, I want to do a slight cleanup:

	compute the term conjunctions optimization in scorer(), so its applied even if we have optional and prohibited clauses that dont exist in the segment (e.g. return null)
	use the term conjunctions optimization when optional.size() == minShouldMatch, as that means they are all mandatory, too.
	don't return booleanscorer1 when optional.size() == minShouldMatch, because it means we have required clauses and in general BS2 should do a much better job (e.g. use advance).
