Spinoff from LUCENE-3842.  This just generalizes the
UpToTwoPositiveIntOutputs to a list of any arbitrary output, by
wrapping any other Outputs impl.  I also made separate methods to
write/read a node-final output: since list of values can only occur on
a final node output, this impl optimizes and avoids writing an extra
byte per label for normal arc labels.

This also fixes a bug in Builder that was sometimes failing to join
multiple outputs together.
