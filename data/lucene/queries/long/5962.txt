The script diffSources.py is used for creating patches for feature branches.  I think the name createPatch.py would be more apt.  It also only works with certain file types and is one of the only python scripts written for python 2.

I'd like to rename this script, upgrade it to python 3, and fix it to work with all files that git/svn would not ignore.
