If you don't reuse your Doc/Field instances (which is very expert: I
suspect few apps do) then there's a lot of garbage created to index each
StringField because we make a new StringTokenStream or
NumericTokenStream (and their Attributes).

We should be able to re-use these instances via a static
ThreadLocal...
