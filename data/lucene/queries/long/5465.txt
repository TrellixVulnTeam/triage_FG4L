The addition of the Solr map-reduce contrib created a new "main.class" property, which is used by the jarify task. Currently only the map-reduce plugin actually set this property, soall other generated JAR files contain the following line:

Main-Class: ${main.class}

This happens because the ANT property "main.class" is undefined for most modules. Maybe this was added for one of the modules (I assume that the Solr-Morphline JARs use this attribute?). We should add some if/then/else structure to the <jarify/> task that only sets this property, if it is actually defined. Otherwise remove it (I think ANT does this automatically if its empty, means string-empty, have to try out)

This leads to an error if the file is double-clicked or started via java -jar:


C:\Users\Uwe Schindler\Desktop>java -jar lucene-core-4.7.0.jar
Fehler: Hauptklasse ${main.class} konnte nicht gefunden oder geladen werden



I opened this issue in LUCENE, because jar files from LUCENE and SOLR are affected.
