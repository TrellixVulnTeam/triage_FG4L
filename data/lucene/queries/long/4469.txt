for some reason (I guess debugging) these explicitly disable checkindex on MDW and call checkindex themselves.

but they dont check its return value!

So these tests could currently all be failing and we wouldnt know (since If i remember right, checkindex catches throwable and records it inside its status)

These tests should be changed to just let MDW run the checkindex, or use _TestUtil.checkIndex.

We should also search the codebase for any other tests doing this.
