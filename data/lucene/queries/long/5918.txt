We used this folder in older times to place older JAR files from previous Lucene version there to run our tests against those (to detect binary backwards breaks).

We no longer do this since Lucene 4, so let's remove the whole folder. Currently it only contains a README.txt.

This issue will remove the folder and fix smoker to not expect this directory in source tree.

Any comments before I do this change?
