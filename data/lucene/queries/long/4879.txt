We could filter stack traces similar to what ANT's JUnit task does. It'd remove some of the noise and make them shorter. I don't think the lack of stack filtering is particularly annoying and it's always to have an explicit view of what and where happened but since Robert requested this I'll add it.

We can always make it a (yet another) test.* option
