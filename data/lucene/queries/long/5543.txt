Since 3.0.x/3.6.x (see LUCENE-5541), Lucene has substantially removed
its reliance on fileExists to the point where I think we can fully
remove it now.

Like the other iffy IO methods we've removed over time (touchFile,
fileModified, seeking back during write, ...), File.exists is
dangerous because a low level IO issue can cause it to return false
when it should have returned true.  The fewer IO operations we rely on
the more reliable/portable Lucene is.
