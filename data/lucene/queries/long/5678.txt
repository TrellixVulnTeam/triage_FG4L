We no longer allow seeking in IndexOutput, so there is no need to use RandomAccessFile. We can change this with a < 1 KiB patch.

Further improvements would be to merge this with OutputStreamIndexOutput, so we get many simplifications.

There is also no reason anymore to separate DataOutput from IndexOutput. The only additional thing is IndexOutput#getFilePointer(), which is handled by  an internal counter (does not use getFilePointer of the underlying RAF) and checksums.
