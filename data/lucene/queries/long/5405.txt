SOLR-5623 included some conversation about the dilemmas of exception management and reporting in the analysis chain. 

I've belatedly become educated about the infostream, and this situation is a job for it. The DocInverterPerField can note exceptions in the analysis chain, log out to the infostream, and then rethrow them as before. No wrapping, no muss, no fuss.

There are comments on this JIRA from a more complex prior idea that readers might want to ignore.
