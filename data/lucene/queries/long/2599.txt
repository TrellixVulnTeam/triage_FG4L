The spatial contrib is blighted by bugs.  The latest series, found by Grant and discussed here shows that we need to re-think the cartesian tier implementation.

Given the need to create a spatial module containing code taken from both lucene and Solr, it makes sense to deprecate the spatial contrib, and start from scratch in the new module.
