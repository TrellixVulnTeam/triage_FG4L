We had a situation where the maven artifacts depended on the wrong version of tika: we should test that the maven dependencies are correct.

An easy way to do this is to force it to download all of its dependencies, and then run our existing license checks over that.

This currently fails: maven is bringing in some extra 3rd party libraries.
