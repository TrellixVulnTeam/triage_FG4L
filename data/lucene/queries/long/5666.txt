Currently the fieldcache is not pluggable at all. It would be better if everything used the docvalues apis.

This would allow people to customize the implementation, extend the classes with custom subclasses with additional stuff, etc etc.

FieldCache can be accessed via the docvalues apis, using the FilterReader api.
