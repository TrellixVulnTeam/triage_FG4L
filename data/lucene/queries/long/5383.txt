If someone submits a pull request, i think we should put it in changes.txt in some way similar to the jira issues:

e.g. for a JIRA issue we do:

* LUCENE-XXXX: Add FooBar.  (Joe Contributor via John Committer)



changes2html recognizes and expands these to jira issue links.

so I think we should be able to do something like:

* pull request #xxx: Add FooBar. (Joe Contributor via John Committer)



and have it link to the request, too.
