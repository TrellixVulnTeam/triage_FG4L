We have some TokenFilters which are only broken with specific options. This includes:


	TrimFilter when updateOffsets=true
	StopFilter, JapanesePartOfSpeechStopFilter, KeepWordFilter, LengthFilter, TypeTokenFilter when enablePositionIncrements=false



I think we should deprecate these behaviors in 4.4 and remove them in trunk.
