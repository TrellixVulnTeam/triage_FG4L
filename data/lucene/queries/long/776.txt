I was just reading the FSDirectory java code, then I found this :

  /** This cache of directories ensures that there is a unique Directory

	instance per path, so that synchronization on the Directory can be used to
	synchronize access between readers and writers.
   *
	This should be a WeakHashMap, so that entries can be GC'd, but that would
	require Java 1.2.  Instead we use refcounts...
   */
  private static final Hashtable DIRECTORIES = new Hashtable();



Since Lucene is now requiring at least 1.2 (for ThreadLocal for instance, which is using BTW some WeakHashMap), maybe it is time to change ?
