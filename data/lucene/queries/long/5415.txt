PostingsHighlighter uses the offsets encoded in the postings lists for the terms to find query matches.

As such, it isn't really suitable for stuff like wildcards for two reasons:
1. an expensive rewrite against the term dictionary (i think other highlighters share this problem)
2. accumulating data from potentially many terms (e.g. reading many postings)

However, we could provide an option for some of these queries to work, but in a different way, that avoids these downsides.

Instead we can just grab the Automaton representation of the queries, and match it against the content directly (which won't blow up).
