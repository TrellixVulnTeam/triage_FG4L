This is really confusing, see LUCENE-4176 where a user hit this.

The example code from the user there reads:


FieldType fieldType = new FieldType();
fieldType.setIndexed(true);
fieldType.setStored(true);



Its really trappy that this does not invoke the analyzer: because historically we did this unless you specified NOT_ANALYZED. 

So i think fieldType.setTokenized(true) should be the default: things like StringField can turn it off.
