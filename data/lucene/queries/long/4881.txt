I'm working on code that needs a hash based int Set.  It will need to iterate over the values, but SentinalIntSet doesn't have this utility feature.  It should be pretty easy to add.

FYI this is an out-growth of a question I posed to the dev list, examining 3 different int hash sets out there: SentinalIntSet, IntHashSet (in Lucene facet module) and the 3rd party IntOpenHashSet (HPPC) â€“ see http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/IntHashSet-SentinelIntSet-SortedIntDocSet-td4037516.html  I decided to go for SentinalIntSet because it's already in Lucene-core, adding the method I need should be easy, and it has a nice lean implementation.
