This option is dangerous. It sounds so good though that people are quick to use it, but it definitely drops entire segments.

The commandline flag should be someting other than -fix (e.g. -exorcise).

I dont agree with the current description of the option either. True, it does have *WARNING* but I think it should read more like the scary options in 'man hdparm'.

Like hdparm, we could fail if you provide it with an even more ridiculous warning, and make you run again with --yes-i-really-know-what-i-am-doing as well.
