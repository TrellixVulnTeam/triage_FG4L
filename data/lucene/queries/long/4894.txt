	Concurrent Indexing and Search
There is no clear explanation regarding those points below.
1. TaxonomyReader should be reopened after IndexReader.
2. TaxonomyWriter should be committed before IndexWriter. TaxonomyWriter should be closed before IndexWriter.
The rationale is that it's ok to see categories to which no document belongs but not ok the other way around.
Beginners may not be able to see this until after they think through it for a long time, which most of them including me wouldn't do.
However, facet user guide doesn't explain the rationale clearly.




	DocumentBuilder & FacetSearchParams.addFacetRequest
They no longer exist in lucene 4.2, but they are used in code examples.




	FacetResultNode.getLabel(TaxonomyReader)
It doesn't eixst in 4.2, but it is mentioned in "Multiple Facet Requests"




	ETC
I don't know if there are other points to be made.
