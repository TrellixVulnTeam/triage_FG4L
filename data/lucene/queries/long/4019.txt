We found out that some recent Dutch hunspell dictionaries contain suffix or prefix rules like the following:


 
SFX Na N 1
SFX Na 0 ste



The rule on the second line doesn't contain the 5th parameter, which should be the condition (a regexp usually). You can usually see a '.' as condition, meaning always (for every character). As explained in LUCENE-3976 the readAffix method throws error. I wonder if we should treat the missing value as a kind of default value, like '.'.  On the other hand I haven't found any information about this within the spec. Any thoughts?
