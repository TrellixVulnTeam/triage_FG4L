We can improve the current format in a few ways:

	speed up Sorted/SortedSet byte[] lookup by structuring the term blocks differently (allow random access, more efficient bulk i/o)
	speed up reverse lookup by adding a reverse index (small: just every 1024'th term with useless suffixes removed).
	use slice API for access to access to binary content, too.
