Currently functionqueries have basically no simple low-level tests.

Found a few minor problems:

	fix -1 summation (in case some, but not all segments are preflex): TotalTermFreq/SumTotalTermFreq
	fix omitTF case (due to LUCENE-2929, docsenum will return null if you ask for freqs but the field is omitTF).
	fix some indexedField vs field mixups
	fix QueryUtils searcher-wrapping to also set the similarity the same as it was on the original searcher.
