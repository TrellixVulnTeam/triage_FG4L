Dev. branch at: https://github.com/dweiss/lucene_solr/tree/rr

Switch the runner to RandomizedRunner. Enforce the following:

	 Random sharing will result in a failure/ exception.
	 Add a validator for testXXX without @Test annotation. (custom test provider added).
	 Make sure tests are executed with assertions enabled (at least for solr/lucene packages).
	 Add a validator for static hook shadowing (no-no).
	 Modify custom execution groups in LTC to be real @Groups.



Follow up from merging with trunk:

	 rename tests.threadspercpu into tests.jvms (Steve)
	 align to 80 cols terminals (Robert) - use simple class names and add truncation padding.
	 the output is emitted twice in case of suite-level errors.
