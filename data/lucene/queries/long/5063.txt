For some use-cases, it would be convenient to be able to store negative values in a GrowableWriter, for example to use it in FieldCache: The first term is the minimum value and one could use a GrowableWriter to store deltas between this minimum value and the current value. (The need for negative values comes from the fact that maxValue - minValue might be larger than Long.MAX_VALUE.)
