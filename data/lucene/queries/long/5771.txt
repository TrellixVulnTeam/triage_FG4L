SpatialOperation (which I wish was named SpatialPredicate) is a bunch of predicates – methods that return true/false based on a pair of shapes.  Some of them don't seem to be defined in a way consistent with their definitions on ESRI's site:
http://edndoc.esri.com/arcsde/9.1/general_topics/understand_spatial_relations.htm  (which is linked as a reference, and is in turn equivalent to OGC spec definitions, I believe).

Problems:

	the definitions make no mention of needing to have area or not, yet some of our predicates are defined as to require area on either the indexed or query shape.
	the definitions make a distinction of the boundary of a shape, yet in Lucene-spatial, there is none.  That suggests our predicates are wrongly chosen since there are official predicates that are boundary-neutral – namely "Covers" and "CoveredBy" in lieu of Contains and Within, respectively.  If we don't rename our predicates, we should at least support the correct predicates names!
	Overlaps appears totally wrong. It should be defined as indexedShape.relate(queryShape) == Intersects  (and thus not Within or Contains or Disjoint).  It's presently defined as the same as Intersects plus the query shape needing area.
