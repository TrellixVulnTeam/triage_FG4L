Today these two are per FacetIndexingParams, which means that once defined, they affect all category lists. This prevents for example to index one category list with OrdinalPolicy.NO_PARENTS and another with OrdinalPolicy.ALL_PARENTS. Especially now that we know NO_PARENTS is faster (see LUCENE-4600), it will be good if users can control this setting per CategoryListParams, and index only the few facets which a document has more than once (e.g. Author) in a separate category list.
