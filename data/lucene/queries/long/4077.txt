The constructor of ToParentBlockJoinCollector allows to turn on the tracking of parent scores and the maximum parent score, however there is no way to access those scores because:

	maxScore is a private field, and there is no getter
	TopGroups / GroupDocs does not provide access to the scores for the parent documents, only the children
