Currently we restring wrting to tests.tempDir after SOLR-4195, but it would be better to restrict more and only let child JVMs write to their working dir and not outside (and maybe corrumpt other JVMs).

The problem with current setup is that the child JVM's policy file does not know the runner number nor the absolute working directory (it must be absolute and platform-specific with backslash/slash/... -> new File(".").getAbsolutePath().

Dawid will release a new Junit4 package with a new sysprop passed to every child with its full CWD: junit4.childvm.cwd

In that case the policy file would use this property (and the clover.db.dir) to allow write access and allow only read/execute access for the rest of the  filesystem.
