Currently, we fail on all javadocs warnings.

However, you get a warning if it cannot download the package-list from sun.com
So I think we should allow you optionally set a sysprop using linkoffline.
Then we would get much less hudson "fake failures"

I feel like Mike opened an issue for this already but I cannot find it.
