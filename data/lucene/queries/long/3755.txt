This stuff is great, it makes it easy to define analyzers:



Analyzer analyzer = new Analyzer() {
    @Override
    protected TokenStreamComponents createComponents(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
      Tokenizer source = new FooTokenizer(reader);
      TokenStream filter = new FooFilter(source);
      filter = new BarFilter(filter);
      return new TokenStreamComponents(source, filter);
    }
  };



But, we should add basic examples to the javadocs I think (we can backport to ReusableAnalyzerBase).
Also it would be nice to throw in an example that adds a CharFilter.
