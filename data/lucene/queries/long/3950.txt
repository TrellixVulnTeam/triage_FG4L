we now fail the build on rat problems (LUCENE-1866),
so we should make it easy to run rat-sources for people
to test locally (it takes like 3 seconds total for the whole trunk)

Also this is safer than putting rat in your ~/.ant/lib because that 
adds some classes from commons to your ant classpath (which we currently
wrongly use in compile).
