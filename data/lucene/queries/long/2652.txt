As a spinn off from this conversation we should rethink the way how we execute testcases with different locals since glover reports appears to throw OOM errors b/c Junit treats each local as a single test case run.

Here are some options:

	select the local at random only run the test with a single local
	set the local via system property -Dtest.locale=en.EN
	run with the default locale only -Dtest.skiplocale=true
	one from the above but only if instrumented with clover (let common tests run all the locale)
