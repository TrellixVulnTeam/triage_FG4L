TaxoReader exposes two structures which provide information about a categories parent/childs/siblings: ParentArray and ChildrenArrays. ChildrenArrays are derived (i.e. created) from ParentArray.

I propose to consolidate all that into one API ParentInfo, or CategoryTreeInfo (a better name?) which will provide the same information, only from one object. So instead of making these calls:



int[] parents = taxoReader.getParentArray();
int[] youngestChilds = taxoReader.getChildrenArrays().getYoungestChildArray();
int[] olderSiblings = taxoReader.getChildrenArrays().getOlderSiblingArray();



one would make these calls:



int[] parents = taxoReader.getParentInfo().parents();
int[] youngestChilds = taxoReader.getParentInfo().youngestChilds();
int[] olderSiblings = taxoReader.getParentInfo().olderSiblings();



Not a big change, just consolidate more code into one logical place. All of these arrays will continue to be lazily allocated.
