I think users get confused about how svn/source is structured,
when in fact we are just producing a modular build.

I think it would be more clear if the lucene stuff was underneath
modules/, thats where our modular API is.

we could still package this up as lucene.tar.gz if we want, and even name
modules/core lucene-core.jar, but i think this would be a lot better
organized than the current:

	lucene
	lucene/contrib
	modules



confusion.
