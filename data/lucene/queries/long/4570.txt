Currently there is source code in lucene/tools/src (e.g. Forbidden APIs checker ant task).

It would be convenient if you could download this thing in your ant build from ivy (especially if maybe it included our definitions .txt files as resources).

In general checking for locale/charset violations in this way is a pretty general useful thing for a server-side app.

Can we either release lucene-tools.jar as an artifact, or maybe alternatively move this somewhere else as a standalone project and suck it in ourselves?
