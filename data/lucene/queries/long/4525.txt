The JavaDoc says:


  /**
   * Close this ReferenceManager to future {@link #acquire() acquiring}. Any
   * references that were previously {@link #acquire() acquired} won't be
   * affected, and they should still be {@link #release released} when they are
   * not needed anymore.
   */



The first sentence is not really clear. I would expect something like:


Close this ReferenceManager when the application is shutting down or the
 underlying index will be disposed. Any references that were previously
 {@link #acquire() acquired} won't be affected, and they should still be 
{@link #release released} when they are not needed anymore.



Further more, the JavaDoc does not declare that an exception will be thrown on any method.
