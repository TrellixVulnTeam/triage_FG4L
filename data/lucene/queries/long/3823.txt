In addition to the filters in contrib/misc for horizontally filtering (by doc-id) AtomicReader, it would be good to have the same vertically (by field). For now I will add this implementation to test-framework, as it cannot stay in contrib/misc, because LTC will need it for maybeWrapReader.

LTC will use this FilterAtomicReader to construct a ParallelAtomicReader out of two (or maybe more) FieldFilterAtomicReaders.
