Spinoff from LUCENE-5952:


	Fix .si to write Version as 3 ints, not a String that requires parsing at read time.




	Lucene42TermVectorsFormat should not use the same codecName as Lucene41StoredFieldsFormat



It would also be nice if we had a "bumpCodecVersion" script so rolling a new codec is not so daunting.
