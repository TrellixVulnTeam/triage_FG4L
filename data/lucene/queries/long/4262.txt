From a discussion on IRC:

	Hoss had the typical clean-jars problem
	I mentioned we should instead use the ivy option of "sync=true", which is just like retrieve except nukes any stuff (e.g. old jars) that shouldn't be there.
	the problem with this is it would also nuke the .sha1 and licensing stuff (its easy to try and see).



So the idea came about we could just have a licenses/ folder for each "product" (lucene, solr) and this has the .sha1's and licensing stuff.

Steve asked what if different modules depended on different versions of the same jar: this is bogus and we should just disallow it!
