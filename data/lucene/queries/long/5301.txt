It would be convenient if all PackedInts had a super-class with the long get(long index) method. Maybe this super-class could even be NumericDocValues so that doc values formats don't need to wrap eg. BlockPackedReader into this kind of construct:


        final BlockPackedReader reader = new BlockPackedReader(data, entry.packedIntsVersion, entry.blockSize, entry.count, true);
        return new LongNumericDocValues() {
          @Override
          public long get(long id) {
            return reader.get(id);
          }
        };



Instead, they could just


        return new BlockPackedReader(data, entry.packedIntsVersion, entry.blockSize, entry.count, true);
