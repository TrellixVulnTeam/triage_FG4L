This patch contains:


	Introduction of abstract class BaseFragListBuilder




	SimpleFragListBuilder now extends BaseFragListBuilder




	FieldFragList is now abstract




	Introduction of SimpleFieldFragList, a simple implementation of  FieldFragList




	Some necessary, minor changes



This is the second (see LUCENE-4091) patch aiming at the introduction of another method for weighting fragments (see LUCENE-3440). 

Tests were okay.
