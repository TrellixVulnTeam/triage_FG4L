There are some places where an int[] could be advantageously replaced with a packed integer array.

I am thinking (at least) of:

	FST.nodeAddress (GrowableWriter)
	FST.inCounts (GrowableWriter)
	FST.nodeRefToAddress (read-only Reader)



The serialization/deserialization methods should be modified too in order to take advantage of PackedInts.get
{Reader,Writer}
.
