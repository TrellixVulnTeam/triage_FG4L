Field.java contains a inlined Keyword-TokenStream. Unfortunately this one is recreated all the time, although one reuses the same Field instance. For NumericTokenStream Field.java reuses it, but the Keyword one not.

We should apply the same logic and lazy init the TokenStream with a setter for the String value and reset(). This would be looking identical to SetNumeric(xx).
