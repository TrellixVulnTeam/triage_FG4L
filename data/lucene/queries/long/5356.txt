I have little proposal for morfologik lucene module. Current module is tightly coupled with polish DICTIONARY enumeration.
But other people (like me) can build own dictionaries to FSA and use it with lucene. 
You can find proposal in attachment and also example usage in analyzer (SlovakLemmaAnalyzer).
It uses dictionary property as String resource from classpath, not enumeration.
One change is, that dictionary variable must be set in MofologikFilterFactory (no default value).
