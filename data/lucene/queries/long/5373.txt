Lucene42DocValuesProducer.ramBytesUsed uses RamUsageEstimator.sizeOf(this) to return an estimation of the memory usage. One of the issues (there might be other ones) is that this class has a reference to an IndexInput that might link to other data-structures that we wouldn't want to take into account. For example, index inputs of a RAMDirectory all point to the directory itself, so Lucene42DocValuesProducer.ramBytesUsed would return the amount of memory used by the whole directory.
