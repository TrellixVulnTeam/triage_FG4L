With jdk8-b89, the linting of javadocs with Eclipse's JDT compiler (ECJ) does no lonmger work:

	The version we currently use (3.7.2) can no longer parse the class files in rt.jar / or does no longer find them
	The latest version (4.2.2) produces a compiler error, because it cannot handle some "default" interface method duplication in some Java Collections interfaces (CharArraySet fails)



I will disable the ECJ linting for now with Java > 1.7
