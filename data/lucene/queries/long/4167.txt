Looking at the code in TwoDoublesStrategy I noticed SpatialOperations.BBoxWithin vs isWithin which confused me.  Looking over the other Strategys I see that really only isWithin and Intersects is supported.  Only TwoDoublesStrategy supports IsDisjointTo.  The remainder of SpatialOperations are not supported.

I don't think we should use SpatialOperation as this stage since it is not clear what Operations are supported by what Strategys, many Operations are not supported, and the code for handling the Operations is usually the same.  We can spin off the code for TwoDoublesStrategy's IsDisjointTo support into a different Strategy.
