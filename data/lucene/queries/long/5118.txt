SpatialStrategy has this abstract method:


/**
   * Make a ValueSource returning the distance between the center of the
   * indexed shape and {@code queryPoint}.  If there are multiple indexed shapes
   * then the closest one is chosen.
   */
  public abstract ValueSource makeDistanceValueSource(Point queryPoint);



I'd like to add another argument double multiplier that is internally multiplied to the result per document.  It's a convenience over having the user wrap this with another ValueSource, and it'd be faster too.  Typical usage would be to add a degrees-to-kilometers multiplier.

The current method could be marked deprecated with a default implementation that invokes the new one with a 1.0 multiplier.
