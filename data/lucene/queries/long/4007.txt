Looking at our forrested site, and trying to think about how we could move our versioned site
away from it, I think as a first step we should look at what really needs to be there.

I think it easily becomes out of date and we don't have good centralized documentation since
stuff is split between javadocs and forrest.

Couldn't queryparsersyntax.xml simply be in the overview/package for the queryparser?
We could just link to that page from the forrest docs menu, then we could link to the syntax from
other places in the javadocs. 
Furthermore, in that case we could link to other queryparser impls documentations (e.g. complexphrase)
so it would probably be more useful.

demo/demo2.xml could just be overview for the demo contrib? currently that one is useless:
https://builds.apache.org/job/Lucene-trunk/javadoc/demo/index.html

scoring.xml could be added to the package documentation of search or similarities or somewhere that 
makes more sense? currently its "almost javadocs" already, except harder to validate none of these
links are actually out of date: my best bet is a ton of them already are!

i'll leave fileformats.xml aside for now, but with many different codec implementations its something
to think about for later too.
