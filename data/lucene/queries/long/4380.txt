spinoff from LUCENE-4371:

Currently NIOFSDirectory.NIOFSIndexInput extends SimpleFSDirectory.SimpleFSIndexInput, but this isn't an is-a relationship at all.

Additionally SimpleFSDirectory has a funky Descriptor class that extends RandomAccessFile that is useless:

    /**
     * Extension of RandomAccessFile that tracks if the file is 
     * open.
     */
...
      // remember if the file is open, so that we don't try to close it
      // more than once



RandomAccessFile is closeable, this is not necessary and I don't think we should be subclassing it.
