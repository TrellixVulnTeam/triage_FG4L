I hit several issues with ToParentBlockJoinQuery/Collector:


	If a given Query sometimes has no child matches then we could hit
    AIOOBE, but should just get 0 children for that parent




	TPBJC.getTopGroups incorrectly throws IllegalArgumentException
    when the child query happens to have no matches




	We have checks that user didn't accidentally pass a child query
    that matches parent docs ... they are only assertions today but I
    think they should be real checks since it's easy to screw up
