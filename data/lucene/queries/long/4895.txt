The "IsDisjointTo" SpatialOperation is not implemented for RecursivePrefixTreeStrategy and some/all others. It has been very low priority because it is simply the inverse of "Intersects" which is universally implemented on the SpatialStrategy implementations.  


	Should spatial "disjoint" count documents that have no spatial data?
	Arguably, there should be one implementation amongst the SpatialStrategies implemented in terms of "Intersects"; this way each strategy need not deal with it.
