Follow-up of LUCENE-5983. We now have 6 doc id set implementations that can be used to cache filter:

	FixedBitSet
	WAH8DocIdSet
	PForDeltaDocIdSet
	EliasFanoDocIdSet
	SparseFixedBitSet
	RoaringDocIdSet



Some of them are required due to unique features that they have (eg. SparseFixedBitSet due to random write-access) but I'm thinking of removing WAH8DocIdSet and PForDeltaDocIdSet since RoaringDocIdSet also has the ability to inverse its encoding in the super-dense case (WAH8 and PForDelta were the only sets to have this ability until now) and tends to be faster to build and to advance.
