With the vast array of new suggester, It would be nice to have a dictionary implementation that could feed the suggesters terms, weights and (optionally) payloads from the lucene index.

The idea of this dictionary implementation is to grab stored documents from the index and use user-configured fields for terms, weights and payloads.

use-case: If you have a document with three fields 

	product_id
	product_name
	product_popularity_score



then using this implementation would enable you to have a suggester for product_name using the weight of product_popularity_score and return you the payload of product_id, with which you can do further processing on (example: construct a url etc).
