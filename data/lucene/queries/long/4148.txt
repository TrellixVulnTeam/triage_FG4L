It would be helpful in TestPackedInts at least, in order to generate random values (as a workaround, we currently generate a random int between 0 and min(Integer.MAX_VALUE, PackedInts.maxValue(bitsPerValue)). Moreover, it would help to fix nextInt for large ranges (calling nextInt(random, -10, Integer.MAX_VALUE) or even nextInt(random, 0, Integer.MAX_VALUE) currently fails because the range of values is > Integer.MAX_VALUE.
