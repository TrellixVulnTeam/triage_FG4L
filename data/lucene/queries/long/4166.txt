TwoDoublesStrategy supports finding Documents that are within a Circle, yet it is impossible to provide one due to the following code found at the start of TwoDoublesStrategy.makeQuery():



Shape shape = args.getShape();
    if (!(shape instanceof Rectangle)) {
      throw new InvalidShapeException("A rectangle is the only supported shape (so far), not "+shape.getClass());//TODO
    }
    Rectangle bbox = (Rectangle) shape;



I think instead the code which handles Circles should ask for the bounding box of the Shape and uses that instead.
