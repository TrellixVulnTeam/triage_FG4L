Today this uses the default implementation, e.g. for readInt(pos):



@Override
public int readInt(long pos) throws IOException {
  slice.seek(pos);
  return slice.readInt();
}



But this causes the bounds to be checked twice. Just like we did for MMap, we can provide a faster implementation that only checks once: yields ~30% speedup.
