IndexReader.decRef() has this code:



    final int rc = refCount.getAndDecrement();
    if (rc == 1) {



I think it will be clearer if it was written like this:



    final int rc = refCount.decrementAndGet();
    if (rc == 0) {



It's a very simple change, which makes reading the code (at least IMO) easier. Will post a patch shortly.
