It would be useful if 

private PriorityQueue retrieveTerms(int docNum) throws IOException {



were public, since it is similar in use to 

public PriorityQueue retrieveTerms(Reader r) throws IOException {



It also seems useful to add 

public String [] retrieveInterestingTerms(int docNum) throws IOException{


to mirror the one that works on Reader.
