Currently FilteredQuery uses either the "old" lucene 3 leap frog approach or pushes the filter down together with accepted docs. Yet there might be more strategies required to fit common usecases like geo-filtering where a rather costly function is applied to each document. Using leap frog this might result in a very slow query if the filter is advanced since it might have linear running time to find the next valid document. We should be more flexible with regards to those usecases and make it possible to either tell FQ what to do or plug in a strategy that applied a filter in a different way.

The current FQ impl also uses an heuristic to decide if RA or LeapFrog should be used. This is really an implementation detail of the strategy and not of FQ and should be moved out.
