Our current suggester impls do prefix matching of the incoming text
against all compiled suggestions, but in some cases it's useful to
allow infix matching.  E.g, Netflix does infix suggestions in their
search box.

I did a straightforward impl, just using a normal Lucene index, and
using PostingsHighlighter to highlight matching tokens in the
suggestions.

I think this likely only works well when your suggestions have a
strong prior ranking (weight input to build), eg Netflix knows
the popularity of movies.
