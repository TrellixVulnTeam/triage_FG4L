Description is exactly as written.

getSequentialSubReaders/getTopLevelReaderContext, these method names are way too long/unuseable. They also have tricky semantics (e.g. returning null).

In lucene 4, people cannot just use any indexreader and get a merged view. So we need to make this stuff easy on them:

	single-syllable method name (leaves(), subs(), i will think on this)
	supports enhanced for-loop (no returning null or anything like that)
	on indexreader (not atomic or composite, plain old indexreader)
