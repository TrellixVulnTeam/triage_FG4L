These are simply sugar methods anyway, and so expert that I don't think we need sugar here at all.
If someone wants to get DocsEnum via a saved TermState they can just use TermsEnum!

But having these public in AtomicReader i think is pretty confusing and overwhelming.

In fact, nothing in Lucene even uses these methods, except a sole assert statement in PhraseQuery, 
which I think can be written more clearly anyway:


         // PhraseQuery on a field that did not index
         // positions.
         if (postingsEnum == null) {
-          assert reader.termDocsEnum(liveDocs, t.field(), t.bytes(), state, false) != null: "termstate found but no term exists in reader";
+          assert te.seekExact(t.bytes(), false) : "termstate found but no term exists in reader";
