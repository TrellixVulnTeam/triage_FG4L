Check consistency with release instructions: http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ReleaseTodo and http://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToRelease

Differences log:

	ant 1.8.x creates empty package-info.class where ant 1.7.x would fail to do so. This is documented at http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/javac.html and is the expected behavior.
	manifest timestamps are slightly different (Created-By - jvm version is formatted differently, I think more human-friendly in 1.8).

1.7: Created-By: 22.1-b02 (Oracle Corporation)
1.8: Created-By: 1.7.0_03-b05 (Oracle Corporation)
