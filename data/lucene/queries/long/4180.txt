Constants.LUCENE_MAIN_VERSION is an internal number (only numbers allowed) thats written into the index, documenting the version of lucene that wrote the segment.

Because we are going to support backwards compat with alpha indexes: its possible we might need to distinguish between these releases.

I propose we encode beta as 4.0.0.1 and final as 4.0.0.2 and so on.
