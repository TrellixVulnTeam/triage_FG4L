The changes-to-html script currently uses WGET or CURL to download the JIRA version lists. When setting up build jobs e.g. on Windows, this makes running changes-to-html a pain. ANT already provides the functionality to download files: Why not download the version list in the ANT macro to a local file and pass this file as an argument to the PERL script? This would also remove the Certificate warnings, as the JDK knows the Thawte certificate and can validate it.
I would be happy to assist with that, but my PERL knowledge is limited...
