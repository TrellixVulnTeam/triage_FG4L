Currently IW fails late and inconsistent if field metadata like an already defined DocValues type or "un"-omitting norms.


we can approach this similar to how we handle consistent field number and:


	throw exception if indexOptions conflict (e.g. omitTF=true versus
false) instead of silently dropping positions on merge
	same with omitNorms
	same with norms types and docvalues types
	still keeping field numbers consistent



this way we could eliminate all these traps and just give an
exception instead.
