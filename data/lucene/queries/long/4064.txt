ContentSource is currently private to DocMaker, however if someone wants to write an AddDocTask that does not use DocMaker, he needs to initialize ContentSource by himself.

It would be better if ContentSource is a shared resource on PerfRunData that is used by DocMaker, rather than owned by it.

I'll post a patch shortly.
