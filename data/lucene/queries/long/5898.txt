We have still some duplicates in build files. RM must change the base version at many places after release.

There is also a bug "Specification-Version:" in JAR files must be numeric only. So I sill set it to ${version.base} which is guaranteed to be numeric only. This is why we had the separate property in common-build. This needs to be fixed in 4.10 - not for relaese - but for development on release branch!

This issue cleans a lot up:

	Use spec.version with version.base as value
	In Maven inject more version numbers, so RM does not need to change anything in POM templates
	Remove useless attributes from some macros
	Inject version numbers also to eclipse/idea/...
	Don't define version properties a second time in root's build.xml (because it does not include common-build, its duplicated there - I will fix this, too)
