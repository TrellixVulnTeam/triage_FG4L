In order to actually add real features (as opposed to just spending 24/7 fixing bugs and back compat), I need a trunk that doesn't have the back compat handcuffs.

In the meantime, we should rename the current trunk (which is totally tied down in back compat already, without even a single release!) to branch_5x while you guys (i wont be doing any back compat anymore) figure out what you want to do with the back compat policly.

Here is the proposal what to do in this issue: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-dev/201409.mbox/%3CCAOdYfZUpAbYp-omdw=ngJSdzBKVHn2ZYdoBZvj1gDxK+LRT1SQ@mail.gmail.com%3E
