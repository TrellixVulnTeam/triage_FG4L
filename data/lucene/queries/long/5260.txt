As discussed in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-5251, it would be nice to make the older suggesters accepting of TermFreqPayloadIterator and throw an exception if payload is found (if it cannot be used). 

This will also allow us to nuke most of the other interfaces for BytesRefIterator.
