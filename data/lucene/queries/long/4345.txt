Lucene/Solr can host huge sets of documents containing lots of information in fields so that these can be used as training examples (w/ features) in order to very quickly create classifiers algorithms to use on new documents and / or to provide an additional service.
So the idea is to create a contrib module (called 'classification') to host a ClassificationComponent that will use already seen data (the indexed documents / fields) to classify new documents / text fragments.
The first version will contain a (simplistic) Lucene based Naive Bayes classifier but more implementations should be added in the future.
