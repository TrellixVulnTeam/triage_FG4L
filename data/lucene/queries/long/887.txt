Adds the ability to IndexWriter to interrupt an ongoing merge. This might be necessary when Lucene is e. g. running as a service and has to stop indexing within a certain period of time due to a shutdown request.

A solution would be to add a new method shutdown() to IndexWriter which satisfies the following two requirements:

	if a merge is happening, abort it
	flush the buffered docs but do not trigger a merge
