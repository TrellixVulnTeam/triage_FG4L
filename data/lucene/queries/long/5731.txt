Currently there is an oversharing problem in packedints that imposes too many requirements on improving it:

	every packed ints must be able to be loaded directly, or in ram, or iterated with.
	things like filepointers are expected to be adjusted (this is especially stupid) in all cases
	lots of unnecessary abstractions
	versioning etc is complex



None of this flexibility is needed or buys us anything, and it prevents performance improvements (e.g. i just want to add 3 bytes at the end of on-disk streams to reduce the number of bytebuffer calls and thats seriously impossible with the current situation).
