We did this for all other files, but not .frq/.prx.

Currently the postings writer only records itself in the blocktree terms dictionary, which is fine, but thats really documenting the .tim itself, that it is "Blocktree with Lucene40Postings metadata".

I think we should put headers in .frq/.prx as well: e.g. it could detect file jumbling.
