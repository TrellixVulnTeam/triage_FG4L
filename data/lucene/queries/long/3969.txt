We made TestRandomChains in LUCENE-3919, which reflects all
analysis components from the classpath and builds analyzers from them,
then checks consistency.

but currently it only supports some tokenizers/tokenfilters/charfilters,
because it hardcodes at certain ctors e.g. Tokenizer(Reader) and Tokenizer(Version+Reader).

Instead we should use all ctors, just filling them in with random data of
whatever argument type they take.
