Some stats for the generated javadocs of 3.6:

	9,146 files
	161,872 KB uncompressed
	25MB compressed (this is responsible for nearly half of our binary release)



The fact we intentionally double our javadocs size with the 'javadocs-all' thing
is truly wasteful and compression doesn't help at all. Just testing, i nuked 'all'
and found:

	4,944 files
	81,084 KB uncompressed
	12.8MB compressed



We need to clean this up for 4.0. We only need to ship javadocs 'one way'.
