We added IS.searchAfter(Query, Filter) but we don't support Sort yet with this API.

I think it might be overkill at least at first to try to implement 12 collector variants for this.
I put the following idea on SOLR-1726:

One idea would be to start with one or two implementations (maybe in/out of order) for the sorting case, and dont overspecialize it yet.


	for page 1, the ScoreDoc (FieldDoc really) will be null, so we just return the normal impl anyway.
	even if our searchAfter isnt huper-duper fast, the user can always make the tradeoff like with page-by-score. they can always just pass null until like page 10 or something if they compute that it only starts to 'help' then.
