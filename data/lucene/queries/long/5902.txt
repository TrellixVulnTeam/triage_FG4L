Thanks to LUCENE-5898 there are many less places to increment version.  However, I still think this script can be useful in automating the entire process (minus the commit).  This would:

	Add new sections to lucene/CHANGES.txt and solr/CHANGES.txt
	Add new version constant
	Change LATEST value
	Change version.base in lucene/version.properties
	Change version used in solr example configs
	Create a BWC index and test if necessary
