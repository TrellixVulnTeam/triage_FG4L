I've been noticing for awhile that the check-legal-lucene always checks /contrib/queries/lib, no matter where it is.  Consequently it never finds the directory.  This seems like a waste in our build and for the life of me I have no idea why it is necessary.  

Offending line is:



<arg value="${basedir}/contrib/queries/lib" />



in check-legal-lucene

Patch will remove this.
