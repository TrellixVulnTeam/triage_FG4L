ant-junit4 is an ANT task for running tests in parallel (on slave JVMs). Its advantages over the current macros:

	dynamic load balancing based on historical test runs and current execution (job-stealing),
	jvm-crash resilience (I wrote tests that actually crash a slave jvms to make sure such an event is reported appropriately),
	nicer console reporting (no need for syserrs on LuceneTestCase level).



More documentation and info will follow as I roll out a patch.
