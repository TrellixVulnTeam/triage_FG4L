It's more and more common for users these days to create very large indices, e.g.  indexing lines from log files, or packets on a network, etc., and it's not hard to accidentally exceed the maximum number of documents in one index.

I think the limit is actually Integer.MAX_VALUE-1 docs, because we use that value as a sentinel during searching.

I'm not sure what IW does today if you create a too-big index but it's probably horrible; it may succeed and then at search time you hit nasty exceptions when we overflow int.

I think it should throw an IndexFullException instead.  It'd be nice if we could do this on the very doc that when added would go over the limit, but I would also settle for just throwing at flush as well ... i.e. I think what's really important is that the index does not become unusable.
