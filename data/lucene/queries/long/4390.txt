branch_4x (only) currently has the following outdated/leftover .sha1s from obselete versions:


$ svn status
!       solr/licenses/junit4-ant-2.0.0.rc5.jar.sha1
!       solr/licenses/randomizedtesting-runner-2.0.0.rc5.jar.sha1



This is easy enough to implement. just run 'ant jar-checksums' before our svn status check.
