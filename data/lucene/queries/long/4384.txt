We have a lot more checks in the build:

If we added 'ant precommit' it would make it easier to run all the (reasonably fast) checks beforehand... and save some typing.

So I think we can just add precommit which is:

	check-svn-working-copy (looks for un-added files, wrong eol-style)
	validate (nocommit/author checks, license headers, 3rd party licenses, forbidden apis)
	javadocs-lint (javadocs + missing/broken links checks)
	test
