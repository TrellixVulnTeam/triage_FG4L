Mike McCandless said in lucene-java-user mailing list.
"Maybe we could add some simple sugar APIs?

Eg something like Collection<CategoryPath> getChildren(int parentOrd)?
 (Or maybe it returns Iterator<CategoryPath>?)"

What about Collection<Integer> getChildren(int parentOrd)?
Integer would be more versatile and can easily be converted to CategoryPath with TaxonomyReader.getPath.
