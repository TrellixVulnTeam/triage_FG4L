Currently LuceneTaxonomyReader does not support NRT - i.e., on changes to LuceneTaxonomyWriter, you cannot have the reader updated, like IndexReader/Writer. In order to do that we need to do the following:


	Add ctor to LuceneTaxonomyReader to allow you to instantiate it with LuceneTaxonomyWriter.
	Add API to LuceneTaxonomyWriter to expose its internal IndexReader
	Change LTR.refresh() to return an LTR, rather than void. This is actually not strictly related to that issue, but since we'll need to modify refresh() impl, I think it'll be good to change its API as well. Since all of facet API is @lucene.experimental, no backwards issues here (and the sooner we do it, the better).
