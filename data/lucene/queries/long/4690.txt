As far as I can tell nothing actually uses the hash codes generated by these methods (not even any tests).  If someone did want to generate a hash, it would be just as fast to do it on the BytesRef after the fact (or even faster from the input number itself).

edit: Uwe pointed out they were used in one place.  Other places still don't need it.
