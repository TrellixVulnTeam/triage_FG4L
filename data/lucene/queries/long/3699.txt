Reading thru the ipadic documentation, i realized we are storing a lot of redundant information,
for example the connection costs for bigram weights are based on POS+inflection data, so its redundant 
to also separately encode POS and inflection data for each entry.

With the patch the dictionary access is also faster and simpler, and TokenInfoDictionary is 1.5MB smaller.
