Some newer dictionaries cant be loaded (arabic, hungarian, turkmen) just because we do a hackish mark/reset thing to go find the SET to know the encoding and then revisit.

Problem is: we would need a 2MB buffer for some of these newer ones, thats a little extreme. So instead we just copy to a tempfile and do 2 passes.

Also fixes a bug where an alias that goes to no flags would cause an exception (this is ok).
