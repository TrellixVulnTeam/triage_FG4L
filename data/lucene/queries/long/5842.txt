For small files (e.g. where we read in all the bytes anyway), we currently validate the checksum on reader init. 

But for larger files like .doc/.frq/.pos/.dvd/.fdt/.tvd we currently do nothing at all on init, as it would be too expensive.

We should at least do this:


// NOTE: data file is too costly to verify checksum against all the bytes on 
// open, but for now we at least verify proper structure of the checksum 
// footer: which looks for FOOTER_MAGIC + algorithmID. This is cheap 
// and can detect some forms of corruption such as file truncation.
CodecUtil.retrieveChecksum(data);
