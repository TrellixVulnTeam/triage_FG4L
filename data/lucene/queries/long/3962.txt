While reviewing the release artifacts I found several issues with the CHANGES.txt file sin Lucene and Solr. Attached is an easy patch:


	we no longer JARJAR commons-csv
	Apache Ivy changes were missing in both CHANGES files
	Restructuring of build system by steven was not mentioned by Solr. This is important as it affects people working with the Solr source code.
