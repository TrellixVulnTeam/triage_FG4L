In LUCENE-5123, we added a new, more flexible, "pull" API for writing
postings.  This API allows the postings format to iterate the
fields/terms/postings more than once, and mirrors the API for writing
doc values.

But that was just the first step (only SimpleText was cutover to the
new API).  I want to cutover more components, so we can (finally)
e.g. play with different encodings depending on the term's postings,
such as using a bitset for high freq DOCS_ONLY terms (LUCENE-5052).
