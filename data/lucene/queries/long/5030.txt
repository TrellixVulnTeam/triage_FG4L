There is a limitation in the current FuzzySuggester implementation: it computes edits in UTF-8 space instead of Unicode character (code point) space. 

This should be fixable: we'd need to fix TokenStreamToAutomaton to work in Unicode character space, then fix FuzzySuggester to do the same steps that FuzzyQuery does: do the LevN expansion in Unicode character space, then convert that automaton to UTF-8, then intersect with the suggest FST.
