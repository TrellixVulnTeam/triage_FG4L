It would be nice to wrap with FIR here sometimes,
one that returns AssertingFields, etc etc.

This way we could check if consumers are doing bogus things (like reading nextDoc after it returned NO_MORE_DOCS, or TermsEnum.next after its exhausted, or things like that).

This would also be nice to catch tests that do this rather than doing
crazy debugging over whats not really a bug.
