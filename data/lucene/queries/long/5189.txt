In LUCENE-4258 we started to work on incremental field updates, however the amount of changes are immense and hard to follow/consume. The reason is that we targeted postings, stored fields, DV etc., all from the get go.

I'd like to start afresh here, with numeric-dv-field updates only. There are a couple of reasons to that:


	NumericDV fields should be easier to update, if e.g. we write all the values of all the documents in a segment for the updated field (similar to how livedocs work, and previously norms).




	It's a fairly contained issue, attempting to handle just one data type to update, yet requires many changes to core code which will also be useful for updating other data types.




	It has value in and on itself, and we don't need to allow updating all the data types in Lucene at once ... we can do that gradually.



I have some working patch already which I'll upload next, explaining the changes.
