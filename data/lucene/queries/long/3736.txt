The plan is:

	Move all subreaders to ctor (builder-like API. First build reader-set, then call build)
	Rename ParallelReader to ParallelAtomicReader
	Add a ParallelCompositeReader with same builder API, but taking any CompositeReader-set and checks them that they are aligned (docStarts identical). The subreaders are ParallelAtomicReaders.
