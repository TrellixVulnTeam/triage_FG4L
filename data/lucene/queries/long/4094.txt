Stated in the code:


    // TODO we can't randomize this yet (it drives ant crazy) but this makes tests reproduce
    // in case machines have different default charsets...
    sb.append(" -Dargs=\"-Dfile.encoding=" + System.getProperty("file.encoding") + "\"");



But this should work without any problems with junit4 because communication streams are separate and we're decoding output properly (or so I hope).
