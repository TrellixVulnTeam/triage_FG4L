The problem is that fields that point to classes go and collect the size recursively. On IBM a class object contains LOTS of references so it goes up to megabytes for a single enumset.

Another issue is that we count the same objects multiple times if they show up again referenced from different fields â€“ we should be counting them once only.

A temporary fix is to exclude enumsets from being counted.
