I added a lot of tests and greatly refined this algorithm to match correct hunspell behavior. there were many bugs:


	recursionLimit was a hack: this is actually specified by the dictionary to be twofold suffix + one prefix, or if COMPLEXPREFIXES is specified, twofold prefix + one suffix. This patch removes cursion limit
	recursion didn't work correctly: it didnt validate multi-level continuation classes correctly.
	add COMPLEXPREFIXES support.
	probably other minor bugs fixed in the process.



I validated all testing against hunspell
