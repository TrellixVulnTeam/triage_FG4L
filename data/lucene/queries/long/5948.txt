I was working on SOLR-6485 when I realized that the first time pause is called even if we write a lot of bytes pause doesn't work correctly because in SimpleRateLimiter.pause() lastNS is 0 and startNS is always more than targetNS.

If we remove the following line from TestRateLimiter.testPause() then the test fails - 



limiter.pause(2);//init



Should we do one of the following ? 
1. Initialize lastNS in the ctor 

lastNS = System.nanoTime();

2. Add a method saying start() which does the same
