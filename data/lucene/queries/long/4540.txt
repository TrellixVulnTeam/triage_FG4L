I was curious what the performance would be, because it might be useful option to use packedints for norms if you have lots of fields and still want good scoring: 

Today the smallest norm per-field-per-doc you can use is a single byte, and if you have f fields with norms enabled and n docs, it uses f * n bytes of space in RAM.

Especially if you aren't using index-time boosting (or even if you are, but not with ridiculous values), this could be wasting a ton of RAM.

But then I noticed there was no clean way to allow you to do this in your Similarity: its a trivial patch.
