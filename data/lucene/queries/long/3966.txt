I'll also fix buildAndPushRelease so it can push to a local URL; this way at any time we can build, push to local staging, and run smoke tester on it, and hopefully nothing fails...

But really any tests in smoke tester should ideally be pushed back earlier in our dev process (into jenkins, into "ant test").
