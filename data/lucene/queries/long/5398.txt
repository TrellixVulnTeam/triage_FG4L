Previous Lucene implementation store field norms of all documents in memory, float values are therefore encoded into byte to minimize memory consumption.
Recent release no longer have this constraint (see LUCENE-5078, and discussion at http://lucene.markmail.org/message/jtwit3pwu5oiqr2h), users are encouraged to implement their own encodeNormValue() to encode them into/decode from any type including int, byte and long, to fulfil their request for precision.
But the legacy NormValueSource still typecast any long encoding into byte, as seen in line 74 in the java file, making any TFIDFSimilarity using more accurate encoding useless.
It should be removed for the greater good.
