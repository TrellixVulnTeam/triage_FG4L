On the flex branch we explored a number of possible intblock
encodings, but for whatever reason never brought them to completion.
There are still a number of issues opened with patches in different
states.

Initial results (based on prototype) were excellent (see
http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2010/08/lucene-performance-with-pfordelta-codec.html
).

I think this would make a good GSoC project.
