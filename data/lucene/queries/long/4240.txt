From LUCENE-3151 (Robert Muir's comments): there is no need for the Analyzer to take in an IndexableField object.  We can simplify this API:

Hey Grant: I know it sounds silly but can we split out the getOffsetGap API change into a separate issue?
This would be nice to fix ASAP.

I dont understand why it takes IndexableField or took Fieldable. All the other methods here like
getPositionIncrementGap take "String fieldName". I think this one should too.

I dont think it needs a boolean for tokenized either: returning a 0 for NOT_ANALYZED fields. 
If you choose NOT_ANALYZED, that should mean the Analyzer is not invoked!

If you want to do expert stuff control the offset gaps between values for NOT_ANALYZED fields, 
then just analyze it instead, with keyword tokenizer!
