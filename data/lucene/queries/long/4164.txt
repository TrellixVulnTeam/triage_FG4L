IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader) needs some improvements:


	It falsely states that this method blocks any add/delete documents attempts.




	It merges all input IndexReaders at once, and not e.g. like MergePolicy does at mergeFactor steps. Therefore I think it'd be good to clarify it to the user, and also encourage him to call this method several times if he has many IndexReaders to merge.
	
		And while at it, mentioning that the IR can be opened with termIndexInterval=-1 since we don't need it during merge will be good â€“ saves RAM.
	
	



I'll attach a patch shortly.
