currently facets depends on analyzers-common, but this is unnecessary.

additionally it has a nice examples/ package (even with javadocs! are they actually seen anywhere?!),
as well as tests for those examples.

I think instead it would be better if facet/ had no dependencies,
and if examples+examples tests were in demo/.
