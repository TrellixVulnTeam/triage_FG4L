It turns out searching arbitrary fields with define FUZZY_SLOP values could be problematic on some types of values. For example a FUZZY_SLOP on dates is ambiguous and needs a definition of a unit like months, days, minutes, etc. An extension on the query grammar that allows some arbitrary text behind the values in combination with a possibility to override the method parsing those values could solve these kinds of problems.
