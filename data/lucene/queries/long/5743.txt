Norms can eat up a lot of RAM, since by default its 8 bits per field per document. We rely upon users to omit them to not blow up RAM, but its a constant trap.

Previously in 4.2, I tried to compress these by default, but it was too slow. My mistakes were:

	allowing slow bits per value like bpv=5 that are implemented with expensive operations.
	trying to wedge norms into the generalized docvalues numeric case
	not handling "simple" degraded cases like "constant norm" the same norm value for every document.



Instead, we can just have a separate norms format that is very careful about what it does, since we understand in general the patterns in the data:

	uses CONSTANT compression (just writes the single value to metadata) when all values are the same.
	only compresses to bitsPerValue = 1,2,4 (this also happens often, for very short text fields like person names and other stuff in structured data)
	otherwise, if you would need 5,6,7,8 bits per value, we just continue to do what we do today, encode as byte[]. Maybe we can improve this later, but this ensures we don't have a performance impact.
