On the solr-user mailing list, Ebisawa & Alex both commented that they've noticed bugs in the grouping code when some documents don't have values in the grouping field.

In Ebisawa's case, he tracked this down to what appears to be some bugs in the logic of the "compareSameType" method of some of the MutableValue implementations.
