even minShouldMatch is supplied to DisjunctionSumScorer it enumerates whole disjunction, and verifies minShouldMatch condition on every doc:



  public int nextDoc() throws IOException {
    assert doc != NO_MORE_DOCS;
    while(true) {
      while (subScorers[0].docID() == doc) {
        if (subScorers[0].nextDoc() != NO_MORE_DOCS) {
          heapAdjust(0);
        } else {
          heapRemoveRoot();
          if (numScorers < minimumNrMatchers) {
            return doc = NO_MORE_DOCS;
          }
        }
      }
      afterNext();
      if (nrMatchers >= minimumNrMatchers) {
        break;
      }
    }
    
    return doc;
  }



Stefan Pohl proposes (as well as I get it) to pop nrMatchers-1 scorers from the heap first, and then push them back advancing behind that top doc. For me the question no.1 is there a performance test for minShouldMatch constrained disjunction.
