BitVector before Lucene 3.4 had many bugs, particulary that it wrote extra bogus trailing crap at the end.

But since Lucene 4.8, we check that we read all the bytes... this check can fail for 3.0-3.3 indexes due to the previous bugs in those indexes, instead users will get exception on open like this: CorruptIndexException(did not read all bytes from file: read 5000 vs 5001....
