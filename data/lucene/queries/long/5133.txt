Today it renders to an HTML string (<b>..</b> for hits) in protected
methods that one can override to change the highlighting, but this is
hard/inefficient to use for search servers that want to e.g. return
JSON representation of the highlighted result.

This is the same issue as LUCENE-4906 (PostingsHighlighter) but for
AnalyzingInfixSuggester's highlights instead.
