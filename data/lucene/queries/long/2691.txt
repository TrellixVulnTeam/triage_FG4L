We should consolidate the IndexWriter.getReader and the IndexReader.reopen semantics, since most people are already using the IR.reopen() method, we should simply add::


IR.reopen(IndexWriter)



Initially, it could just call the IW.getReader(), but it probably should switch to just using package private methods for sharing the internals
