SortingDocsAndPositionsEnum could easily save memory by using a Lucene40TCF-like compression method for positions, offsets and payloads:

	delta-encode positions and startOffsets (with the previous end offset),
	store the length of the tokens instead of their end offset (endOffset == startOffset + length),
	use a single bit to say whether the token has a payload.
