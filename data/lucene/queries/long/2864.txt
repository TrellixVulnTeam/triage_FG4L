the maximum within-document TF is a very useful scoring value, 
we should expose it so that people can use it in scoring

consider the following sim:


@Override
public float idf(int docFreq, int numDocs) {
  return 1.0F; /* not used */
}

@Override
public float computeNorm(String field, FieldInvertState state) {
  return state.getBoost() / (float) Math.sqrt(state.getMaxTF());
}



which is surprisingly effective, but more interesting for practical reasons.
