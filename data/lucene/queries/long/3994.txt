The nightly builds are taking 4-7 hours.

This is caused by a few bad apples (can be seen https://builds.apache.org/job/Lucene-trunk/1896/testReport/).

The top 5 are (all in analysis):


	TestSynonymMapFilter: 1 hr 54 min
	TestRandomChains: 1 hr 22 min
	TestRemoveDuplicatesTokenFilter: 32 min
	TestMappingCharFilter: 28 min
	TestWordDelimiterFilter: 22 min



so thats 4.5 hours right there for that run....
