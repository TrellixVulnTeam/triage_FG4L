Look under 'spatial', RecursivePrefixTreeStrategyTestCase and TwoDoublesStrategyTestCase
don't get invoked.

I suspect this is something in junit4 that doesnt like the fact that these classes extend
a base class that takes a generic type? 

Because if i just click 'run tests' from this folder in my IDE, then they run.
