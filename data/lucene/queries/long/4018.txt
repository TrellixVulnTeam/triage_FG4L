The #merge method of the PostingsConsumer receives MappingMultiDocsEnum and MappingMultiDocsAndPositionsEnum as postings enum. In certain case (with specific postings formats), the #merge method needs to be overwritten, and the underlying DocsEnums wrapped by the MappingMultiDocsEnum need to be accessed.

The MappingMultiDocsEnum class should provide a method #getSubs similarly to MultiDocsEnum class.
