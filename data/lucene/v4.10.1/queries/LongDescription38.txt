When you create a ranged query and omit the lower term, my expectation 
would be that I would find everything less than the upper term. Now if I pass
false for the inclusive term, then I would expect that I would find all
terms less than the upper term excluding the upper term itself.

What is happening in the case of lower_term=null, upper_term=x,
inclusive=false is that empty strings are being excluded because 
inclusive is set false, and the implementation of RangedQuery creates a default 
lower term of Term(fieldName, ""). Since it's not inclusive, it excludes "". 
This isn't what I intended, and I don't think it's what most people would 
imagine RangedQuery would do in the case I've mentioned.

I equate lower=null, upper=x, inclusive=false to Field < x. lower=null,
upper=x, inclusive=true would be Field <= x. In both cases, the only
difference should be whether or not Field = x is true for the query.
