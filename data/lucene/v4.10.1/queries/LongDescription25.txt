When I want to do the following query (example):
(fieldx : xxxxx OR fieldy : xxxxxxxx)AND(fieldx : stopword OR fieldy : stopword)
it will search (after passing the Analyzer including a StopFilter) for 
(fieldx : xxxxx OR fieldy : xxxxxx) AND() and give a wrong searchresult or a 
NullPointerException.
