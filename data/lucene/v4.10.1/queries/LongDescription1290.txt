The Hits class has several drawbacks as pointed out in LUCENE-954.
The other search APIs that use TopDocCollector and TopDocs should be used instead.

This patch:

	deprecates org/apache/lucene/search/Hits, Hit, and HitIterator, as well as
  the Searcher.search( * ) methods which return a Hits Object.
	removes all references to Hits from the core and uses TopDocs and ScoreDoc
  instead
	Changes the demo SearchFiles: adds the two modes 'paging search' and 'streaming search',
  each of which demonstrating a different way of using the search APIs. The former
  uses TopDocs and a TopDocCollector, the latter a custom HitCollector implementation.
	Updates the online tutorial that descibes the demo.



All tests pass.
