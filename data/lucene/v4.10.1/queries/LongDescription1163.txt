I try to use the CharArraySet for a filter I am writing. I heavily use char-arrays in my code to speed up things. I stumbled upon a bug in CharArraySet while doing that.

The method public boolean contains(char[] text, int off, int len) seems not to work.

When I do 


if (set.contains(buffer,offset,length) {
  ...
}



my code fails.

But when I do


if (set.contains(new String(buffer,offset,length)) {
   ...
}



everything works as expected.

Both variants should behave the same. I attach a small piece of code to show the problem.
