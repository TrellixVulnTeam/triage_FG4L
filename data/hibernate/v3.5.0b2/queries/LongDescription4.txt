The code in addCacheableFile() checked for:

	xmlFile.length() == lazyfile.length();
This will probably be never true, so cached files were never loaded



This patch also adds the following:

	added hibernate.use_cached_mapping_files property to turn on/off caching
if use_cached_mapping_files is true:
	addFile() automatically use addCacheableFile()
	addResource() checks if a resource is a file. If it is a file, it will use addCacheableFile() instead of addInputstream()
