I was experimenting with the new filter feature and sub-selects. I don't know if this is intended to work, but I found that if I used definitions like this:

<filter name="myFilter" condition="exists (select ...)"/>

The exists keyword is prefixed with the table name, as if it was a column:

select foo0_.id as col_0_0_ from Foo foo0_ where foo0_.exists (select ...)
