We would like more control over Session caching.

	ability to bypass the cache when loading data
	ability to evict all instances of a specified persistent class
	ability to automatically evict instances after their changes are flushed, flushAndClear() ?



The critical issue for us is the ability to bypass the cache; the other requests are nice-to-haves.  In general, it seems like the Session cache could be as configurable as the JVM cache.

The rationale for this request has been discussed in the forums:
