It would be nice to know what class an entity has been mapped to when intercepting instantiation.

The parameter could be the class name or an actual class instance (ie of type String or Class), either would be useful.

If this parameter is not present the interceptor has to know what actual class each entity has been mapped to.  That seems to impose a lot on the interceptor & feels fragile.
