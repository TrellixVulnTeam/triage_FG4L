It is currently difficult to batch the creation of persistent entities that maintain associations with other entities.

Add necessary api to hibernate to support the save or update of a collection of entities. An optimization can be applied in this scenario to group inserts / updates by entity class, or table. This will enable the hibernate engine to utilize batching if available, drastically improving performance over a network.
