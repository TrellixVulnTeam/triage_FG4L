I don't like JDO at all, but it may have a good feature : the fetch groups. Instead of saying in each request which relations (or property now) I want to be fetch, I could says which fetch groups I want to be loaded. I will be usefull for complex objects will lot of relationship. Each fetch group will represent a view to the object. 

from Contract c 
  left join fetch c.customer 
  left join fetch c.items
  left join fetch c.foo
==>
from Contract c
  left join fetch c.fetchGroup1

with :
  <many-to-one name="customer" fetch-group="fetchGroup1" />
  <set name="items" fetch-group="fetchGroup1, fetchGroup2" >
  <many-to-one name="foo" fetch-group="fetchGroup1" />
