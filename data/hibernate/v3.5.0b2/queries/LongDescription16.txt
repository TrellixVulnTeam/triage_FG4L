It would be nice to be able to do explicit joins on unrelated classes with HQL:

(hope this renders correctly)

          select empl, phone
            from org.example.Employee empl
 left outer join org.example.PhoneBook phone
              on phone.lastName = empl.lastName
             and phone.firstName = empl.firstName
           where empl.salaryGrade > 10

Note that this would also implicity solve HB-1089 because you could list join criteria that match what Hibernate would have chosen anyway (i.e., list a many-to-one relationship as a criteria explicitly).

Syntactically this could be disambiguated from the existing join syntax because the token after "join" is a class name rather than a property name.
