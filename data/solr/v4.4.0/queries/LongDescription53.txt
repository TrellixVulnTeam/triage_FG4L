Our index directories are symbolic links to a shared location because we use capistrano to deploy our Ruby on Rails application.  This caused problems with snappuller and snapinstaller, so I added the -L option to the find command to make it work.

I also modified snappuller to rsync over ssh, which means there is no need to run the rsync daemon - one less service to run.

I will attach the patch.
