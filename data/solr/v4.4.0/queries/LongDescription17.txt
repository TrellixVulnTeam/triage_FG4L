Attaching an XML schema definition for the responses and the update requests. I needed to do this for myself anyway, so I might as well contribute it to the project.

At the moment, I have no plans to write an XSD for the config documents, but it wouldn't be a bad idea.

TODO: change the schema URL. I'm guessing that Apache already has some sort of naming convention for these?
