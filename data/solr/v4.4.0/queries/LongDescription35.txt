Tricia Williams reported problems with Cyrillic charsets when trying to search using the admin application, specifically NPEs and bad results.  

This patch fixes the webapp by specifying a character encoding for each of the admin pages.  

I also discovered a second issue in StrUtils that wasn't encoding UTF-8 data properly, so I fixed that.  I'm attaching 2 patches.
