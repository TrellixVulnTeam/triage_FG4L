Here are a few classes that connect to a Solr instance to perform searches.  Results are returned in a Response object.  The Response encapsulates a List<Map<String,Field>> that gives you access to the key data in the results.  This is the main part that I'm looking for comments on.  

There are 2 dependencies for this code: JDOM and Commons HttpClient.  I'll remove the JDOM dependency in favor of regular DOM at some point, but I think that the HttpClient dependency is worthwhile here.  There's a lot that can be exploited with HttpClient that isn't demonstrated in this class.  The purpose here is mainly to get feedback on the API of SolrSearcher before I start optimizing anything.
