SOLR-11 contains an ArrayQueue.java attachment which yonik described as a "premature optimization, writing a circular queue (power-of-two based) that's about twice as fast as a LinkedList for our typical usage"

if someone is so inclined, if may be worthwhile to modify BufferedTokenStream to use this (and benchmarking that it really is faster)
