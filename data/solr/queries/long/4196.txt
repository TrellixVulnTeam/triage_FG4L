sub-task for SOLR-4083. If we're going to try to obsolete solr.xml, we need to pull all of the specific XML processing out of Config and Container. Currently, we refer to xpaths all over the place. This JIRA is about providing a thunking layer to isolate the XML-esque nature of solr.xml and allow a simple properties file to be used instead which will lead, eventually, to solr.xml going away.
