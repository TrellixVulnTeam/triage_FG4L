Core-Admin in 4.x allows to create new cores on the fly, but one has to create the directories beforehand. 

The information that this is actually required is not directly displayed to the user (because it's a nested exception), so the only thing he sees is:

Error CREATEing SolrCore 'new_core': Unable to create core: new_core

which doesn't really point out the problem.
