Can you please verify if this issue is simply due to improper implementation, or if it's a bug in Solr?

Also, I should note that a static reference to fieldB does handle multiple values correctly.
Example: <field name="fieldB" column="VALUE_COLUMN" clob="true" />

It only fails when I try to set the field names dynamically.
