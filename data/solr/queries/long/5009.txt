Windows fails to delete files when they are open. CoreContainer opens a second SolrResourceLoader (implicit) when calling ConfigSolr.fromFile(). It should not do this and use the main loader, whcih is closed on shutdown.

This will remove the support for implicit ResourceLoader in ConfigSolr, preventing multiple classloaders for the same solr home.
