Following the discussion on SOLR-5528. It would be nice to support suggest queries to be processed by more than one suggesters configured in one suggest component.

The new response format is as follows:


{
    responseHeader: {
        status: 0,
        QTime: 3
    },
    suggest: {
        suggester1: {
            e: {
                numFound: 1,
                suggestions: [
                    {
                        term: "electronics and computer1",
                        weight: 100,
                        payload: ""
                    }
                ]
            }
        },
        suggester2: {
            e: {
                numFound: 1,
                suggestions: [
                    {
                        term: "electronics and computer1",
                        weight: 10,
                        payload: ""
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}


where 'suggest1' and 'suggest2' are the names of the configured suggester and 'e' is the query.

Example query:


localhost:8983/solr/suggest?suggest=true&suggest.dictionary=suggest1&suggest.dictionary=suggest2&suggest.q=e



Example configuration:


  <searchComponent name="suggest" class="solr.SuggestComponent">
  	<lst name="suggester">
      <str name="name">suggester1</str>
      <str name="lookupImpl">FuzzyLookupFactory</str>      
      <str name="dictionaryImpl">DocumentDictionaryFactory</str>      
      <str name="field">cat</str>
      <str name="weightField">price</str>
      <str name="suggestAnalyzerFieldType">string</str>
    </lst>
  	<lst name="suggester">
      <str name="name">suggester2</str>
      <str name="lookupImpl">FuzzyLookupFactory</str>      
      <str name="dictionaryImpl">DocumentDictionaryFactory</str>     
      <str name="field">name</str>
      <str name="weightField">price</str>
      <str name="suggestAnalyzerFieldType">string</str>
    </lst>
  </searchComponent>
