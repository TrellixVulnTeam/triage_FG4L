java -Ddata=args -Dcommit=no -jar post.jar '<delete><id>SP2514N</id></delete>'

and

java -Ddata=args -jar post.jar '<delete><query>name:DDR</query></delete>'

should have their single quotes replaced with double quotes.  Otherwise, it results in the following error on windows command line:

(sample DOS window FAILS)
C:\downloads\temp\apache-solr-1.2.0\example\exampledocs>java -Ddata=args -jar post.jar '<delete><query>name:DDR</query></delete>'
< was unexpected at this time.

(sample DOS window WORKS)
C:\downloads\temp\apache-solr-1.2.0\example\exampledocs>java -Ddata=args -jar post.jar "<delete><query>name:DDR</query></delete>"

As demonstrated double quotes works with windows.  I also tested double quotes in cygwin, and it should presumably work for linux/UNIX as well.

I started to do a patch, but I see there are three locations where updates might need to be made and I wasn't sure how PDF files were generated, so here's the list of effected source files:
