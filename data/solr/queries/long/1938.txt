The ElisionFilterFactory is useful for removing french articles from words (e.g. l'avion -> avion, see its tests).

But the factory itself isnt very friendly, you need to provide an actual text file listing these, which is sorta overkill
Such a text file would look like:

# below are my articles
l
m
t
...



I propose instead of throwing a RuntimeException if you dont provide the articles param, to just use the default set
already in ElisionFilter: (l, m, t, qu, n, s, j)

It wont backwards break anyone as if they weren't providing it, they were getting RuntimeException before.
