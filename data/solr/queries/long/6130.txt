There are problems with the solr-cell dependency configuration:


	Despite the fact that the asm:asm dependency was removed in LUCENE-4263, and re-addition effectively vetoed by Uwe/Robert in SOLR-4209, asm:asm:3.1 was re-added with no apparent discussion by SOLR-1301 in Solr 4.7.
	The Tika 1.5 upgrade (SOLR-5763) failed to properly upgrade the asm:asm:3.1 dependency to org.ow2.asm:asm-debug-all:4.1 (see TIKA-1053).
	New Tika dependency com.uwyn:jhighlight:1.0 was not added.



Uwe Schindler, do you have any opinions on the asm issues?  In particular, would it make sense to have an additional asm dependency (asm-debug-all in addition to asm)?
