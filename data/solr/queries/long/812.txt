I'm looking at the DataImport code as of Solr v1.3 and using it with Postgres and very large data sets and there some improvement suggestions I have.

1. call setReadOnly(true) on the connection.  DIH doesn't change the data so this is obvious.

2. call setAutoCommit(false) on the connection.   (this is needed by Postgres to ensure that the fetchSize hint actually works)

3. call setMaxRows(X) on the statement which is to be used when the dataimport.jsp debugger is only grabbing X rows.  fetchSize is just a hint and alone it isn't sufficient.
