Using the 3.5 example this query...

q = bogus:xxx AND text_t:yak
http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?debugQuery=true&qf=a_t+b_t&defType=edismax&mm=0&q=bogus:xxx+AND+text_t:yak

parses as...

+(DisjunctionMaxQuery((a_t:bogus:xxx | b_t:bogus:xxx)) DisjunctionMaxQuery((a_t:and | b_t:and)) text_t:yak)



(Note that "AND" is considered a term and is searched for in the qf fields)

But this query...
q = foo_s:xxx AND text_t:yak
http://localhost:8983/solr/select/?debugQuery=true&qf=a_t+b_t&defType=edismax&mm=0&q=foo_s:xxx+AND+text_t:yak

parses correctly treating AND as an explicit operator...

+(+foo_s:xxx +text_t:yak)



(this problem also seems to affect trunk circa 2012-03-20)
