I am testing the code from SOLR-127. I have seen following behaviour for the Expires HTTP header.

Solr-config:

<httpCaching lastModFrom="dirLastMod" etagSeed="IBX20080304">
    <cacheControl>max-age=2419200</cacheControl>
</httpCaching>



Generated HTTP-headers:
HTTP/1.x 200 OK
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Cache-Control: max-age=2419200
Expires: Mon, 11 Feb 2008 15:24:49 GMT
Last-Modified: Fri, 29 Feb 2008 14:25:07 GMT
Etag: "NmVmZmNiYzdjODgwMDAwMElCWDIwMDgwMzA0"
Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Encoding: gzip
Vary: Accept-Encoding

We are going back in time. max-age=2419200 is 4 weeks in seconds. I checked the code and I have not found anything that could trigger that behaviour.
