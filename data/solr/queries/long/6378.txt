When running the DIH example, select core "tika", and click data import.
Click the button "Exectute" and you will see an error:

Indexing failed. Rolled back all changes.
Requests: 0, Fetched: 0, Skipped: 0, Processed: 0
Started: less than a minute ago, Rolledback: less than a minute ago

This is because the file the import handler is configured to import
url="../contrib/extraction/src/test-files/extraction/solr-word.pdf"
no longer exists
