When debugging configuration and performance, I often:
 1. Look at stats values
 2. run some queries
 3. See how the stats values changed

This is fine, but is often a bit clunky and you have to really know what you are looking for to see any changes.

It would be great if the 'plugins' page had a button that would make this easier
