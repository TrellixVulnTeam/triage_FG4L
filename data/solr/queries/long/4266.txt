When using HttpSolrServer for requests with no response parser, any unpredicted status code (401, 500...) will throw the exception properly, but will not close the connection. Since no handle for connection is returned in case of exception, it should be closed. So only case where it should not be closed is when the stream is actually returned, that is, when no response parser is used and the call is successful.
