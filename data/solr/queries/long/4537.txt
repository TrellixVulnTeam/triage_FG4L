SOLR-4503 introduced schema information REST API resources for fields, dynamicFields, fieldTypes, and copyFields.

However, TestFieldsCollectionResource tests make assumptions about the order in which results are returned, and FieldsCollectionResource doesn't provide them in a stable order, and as a result, those tests are failing in environments where the hash iteration order is different from mine (see http://markmail.org/message/phknufx4ywlc7eiw).

Also, FieldsCollectionResource always ignores the "includeDynamic" query parameter, which makes sense in the get-me-info-on-all-the-fields case (i.e., the "fl" query parameter is not specified), but when the "fl" query parameter is specified, the "includeDynamic" query parameter should be respected, so that if a requested field doesn't match an explicit field, but matches a dynamic field, properties for the matching dynamic field are returned.
