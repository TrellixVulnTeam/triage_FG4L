Right now when attempting to reload a non existent core, the CoreAdmin response just contains a stack trace and a message saying "Error handling 'reload' action" with no further information. 
It'd be good to change it to continue printing stack trace in the log but returning a readable message with more information.

Ideally, we should be fixing this for other CoreAdmin calls too.
