Typical collection admin commands are long running and it is very common to have the requests get timed out.  It is more of a problem if the cluster is very large.Add an option to run these commands asynchronously

add an extra param async=true for all collection commands

the task is written to ZK and the caller is returned a task id. 
as separate collection admin command will be added to poll the status of the task

command=status&id=7657668909

if id is not passed all running async tasks should be listed

A separate queue is created to store in-process tasks . After the tasks are completed the queue entry is removed. OverSeerColectionProcessor will perform these tasks in multiple threads
