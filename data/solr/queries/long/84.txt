This issue was original a scratch pad for various ideas for new Logos.  It is now being used as a repository for submissions for the Solr Logo Contest...

Note that many of the images currently attached are not eligible for the contest since they do not meet the official guidelines for new Apache project logos (in particular that the full project name "Apache Solr" must be included in the Logo).  Only eligible attachments will be included in the official voting.
