The XML-Output (simplified example attached) is missing one small information .. which could be very useful to build an nice Analysis-Output, and that's "Token-Relation" (if there is special/correct word for this, please correct me).

Meaning, that is actually not possible to "follow" the Analysis-Process (completly) while the Tokenizers/Filters will drop out Tokens (f.e. StopWord) or split it into multiple Tokens (f.e. WordDelimiter).

Would it be possible to include this Information? If so, it would be possible to create an improved Analysis-Page for the new Solr Admin (SOLR-2399) - short scribble attached
