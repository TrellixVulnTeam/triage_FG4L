...&facet=true&facet.pivot=
{!ex=category}category_id,subcategory_id&fq={!tag=category}category_id=42

generates the following error : "undefined field {!ex=category}
category_id"

If you filter on subcategory_id, the facet.pivot result will contain only results from this subcategory. It's a loss of function since you can't alter this behavior with local params.
