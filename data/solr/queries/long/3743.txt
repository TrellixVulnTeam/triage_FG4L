Stored copyField targets do not work well with other solr features.
Consider the following getting started guide:
http://yonik.com/solr/getting-started/

After the document update, a get of the resulting document reveals:

/opt/code/lusolr/solr$ curl http://localhost:8983/solr/get?id=book1
{
  "doc":
  {
    "id":"book1",
    "title":["American Gods"],
    "author":"Neil Gaiman",
    "author_s":["Neil Gaiman",
      "Neil Gaiman"],
    "cat":["fantasy"],
    "pubyear_i":2001,
    "ISBN_s":"0-380-97365-0",
    "_version_":1410692581016207360}}



note the double author_s.

A user using realtime-get and optimistic concurrency may run across the same issue.  The other field stored field that is a copyField target is price_c.
