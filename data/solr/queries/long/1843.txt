When i run multiple independent SOLR webapps both with JMX enabled there seems to be some sort of collision when registering Mbeans causing my application server to throw exceptions for each mbean it tries to register for all applications after the first.

This seems to be due to collision issue of sorts with both applications trying to register their mbeans under the name "solr"

This patch fixes the issue by allowing the user to specify the name under which MBeans are registered in solrconfig.xml like so:
  <jmx rootName="mySolr" /> 

i went with rootName since in the code the variable is called jmxRootName.
