When I use the edismax query handler with qf=samenvatting and have a query of the form

a\:b AND cde


then the parsedquery ends up as:

(+(DisjunctionMaxQuery((samenvatting:"a b")) DisjunctionMaxQuery((samenvatting:and)) DisjunctionMaxQuery((samenvatting:cde))))/no_coord


note that the AND operator is ignored, and a search for the word AND is performed.
As far as I've seen it doesn't matter if the part before the \: is a real field or not.
