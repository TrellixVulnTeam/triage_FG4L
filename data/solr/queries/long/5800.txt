I have an example in Solr In Action that uses the
PatternReplaceCharFilterFactory and now it doesn't work in 4.7.0.
Specifically, the <fieldType> is:

    <fieldType name="text_microblog" class="solr.TextField"
positionIncrementGap="100">
      <analyzer>
        <charFilter class="solr.PatternReplaceCharFilterFactory"
                    pattern="([a-zA-Z])\1+"
                    replacement="$1$1"/>
        <tokenizer class="solr.WhitespaceTokenizerFactory"/>
        <filter class="solr.WordDelimiterFilterFactory"
                generateWordParts="1"
                splitOnCaseChange="0"
                splitOnNumerics="0"
                stemEnglishPossessive="1"
                preserveOriginal="0"
                catenateWords="1"
                generateNumberParts="1"
                catenateNumbers="0"
                catenateAll="0"
                types="wdfftypes.txt"/>
        <filter class="solr.StopFilterFactory"
                ignoreCase="true"
                words="lang/stopwords_en.txt"
                />
        <filter class="solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory"/>
        <filter class="solr.ASCIIFoldingFilterFactory"/>
        <filter class="solr.KStemFilterFactory"/>
      </analyzer>
    </fieldType>

The PatternReplaceCharFilterFactory (PRCF) is used to collapse
repeated letters in a term down to a max of 2, such as #yummmm would
be #yumm

When I run some text through this analyzer using the Analysis form,
the output is as if the resulting text is unavailable to the
tokenizer. In other words, the only results being displayed in the
output on the form is for the PRCF

This example stopped working in 4.7.0 and I've verified it worked
correctly in 4.6.1.

Initially, I thought this might be an issue with the actual analysis,
but the analyzer actually works when indexing / querying. Then,
looking at the JSON response in the Developer console with Chrome, I
see the JSON that comes back includes output for all the components in
my chain (see below) ... so looks like a UI rendering issue to me?

the JSON returned to the browser has evidence that the full analysis chain was applied, so this seems to just be a rendering issue.
