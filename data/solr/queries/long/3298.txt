The javadoc for the LB server begins:


LBHttpSolrServer or "LoadBalanced HttpSolrServer" is a load balancing wrapper to CommonsHttpSolrServer.


But that class is no longer in the source tree, at least under that name.

What's the new theory? Is this just the class to use, all by itself? If so, I can submit a patch to the doc.
