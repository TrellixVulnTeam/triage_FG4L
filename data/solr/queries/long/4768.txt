I know why the two .wars are different:

The binary package Solr war's target chain is:

  
'package'->'create-package'->'dist'->'dist-war'->webapp:'dist'


The maven Solr war's target chain is:

  
'generate-maven-artifacts'->webapp:'dist-maven'->webapp:'dist'


So both create the war using webapp:'dist', but only 'dist-war' passes in a modified 'exclude.from.war' property definition (which is empty by default):

  
<property name="exclude.from.war" value="*slf4j*,log4j-*" />


As a result, the maven Solr war contains logging jars while the official war does not.

I think the fix is to make the above the default setting, rather than passing in a non-default property value from 'dist-war'.
