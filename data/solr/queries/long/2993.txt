A SpellCheckComponent enhancement, leveraging the WordBreakSpellChecker from LUCENE-3523:


	Detect spelling errors resulting from misplaced whitespace without the use of shingle-based dictionaries.
	Seamlessly integrate word-break suggestions with single-word spelling corrections from the existing FileBased-, IndexBased- or Direct- spell checkers.
	Provide collation support for word-break errors including cases where the user has a mix of single-word spelling errors and word-break errors in the same query.
	Provide shard support.
