Implement a subclass of Lookup based on finite state automata/ transducers (Lucene FST package). This issue is for implementing a relatively basic prefix matcher, we will handle infixes and other types of input matches gradually. Impl. phases:


	write a DFA based suggester effectively identical to ternary tree based solution right now,
	baseline benchmark against tern. tree (memory consumption, rebuilding speed, indexing speed; reuse Andrzej's benchmark code)
	modify DFA to encode term weights directly in the automaton (optimize for onlyMostPopular case)
	benchmark again
	benchmark again
	modify the tutorial on the wiki http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Suggester
