When building Lucene/Solr with Apache Maven 3, all MANIFEST.MF files included into JAR artifacts contain non-parsed POM variables: namely, there are entries like

Specification-Version: 5.0.0.${now.version}

In the end, Solr displays these values on admin page in "Versions" section.

This is caused by unresolved bug in maven-bundle-plugin (FELIX-3392).
