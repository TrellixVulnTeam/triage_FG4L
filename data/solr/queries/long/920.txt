if there are 1000's of cores then the cost of loading unloading schema.xml can be prohibitive
similar to SOLR-919 we can also cache the DOM object of schema.xml if the location on disk is same.  All the dynamic properties can be replaced lazily when they are read.

We can go one step ahead in this case. Th IndexSchema object is immutable . So if there are no core properties then the same IndexSchema object can be used across all the cores
