When trying to monitor our Solr instances with JMXtrans (https://github.com/lookfirst/jmxtrans), we discovered that all the Mbeans were identifying themselves as java.lang.String.   This breaks the GangliaWriter in JMXtrans because the software decides it's a string instead of a numeric values and you can't graph a string.   Other software we are monitoring with JMXtrans (e.g. Kafka) correctly identify their numeric values as numbers (doubles in this case).

For example, avgTimePerRequest in Solr is identified as a string which makes no sense.  This behavior makes Solr less interoperable with the rest of the Java ecosystem.

The problem code is in JmxMonitoredMap.java

NamedList dynamicStats = infoBean.getStatistics();
if (dynamicStats != null) {
  for (int i = 0; i < dynamicStats.size(); i++) 
{
    String name = dynamicStats.getName(i);
    if (!staticStats.contains(name))
      attrInfoList.add(new MBeanAttributeInfo(dynamicStats.getName(i),
              String.class.getName(), null, true, false, false));
  }

I will try to attach a screenshot. 

Thanks for Solr!  We use the heck out of it, it's awesome.
