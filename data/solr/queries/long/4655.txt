Currently we make a unique node name by using the host address as part of the name. This means that if you want a node with a new address to take over, the node name is misleading. It's best if you set custom names for each node before starting your cluster. This is cumbersome though, and cannot currently be done with the collections API. Instead, the overseer could assign a more generic name such as nodeN by default. Then you can easily swap in another node with no pre planning and no confusion in the name.
