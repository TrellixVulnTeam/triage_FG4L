The following line in CachingDirectoryFactory is resulting in a lot of noise in my branch_4x logs.  It was added by Yonik's recent major sync from trunk to branch_4x, r1420992.

log.info("Releasing directory:" + cacheValue.path);

This was probably added to debug a problem, but it seems to get called a lot.  The specific thing that led me to bring it up is that it is logged four times for every call to /admin/mbeans.  When you've got seven cores and you hit them all, it increases the logging from 7 lines to 35.  IMHO, it should be moved to debug instead of info.
