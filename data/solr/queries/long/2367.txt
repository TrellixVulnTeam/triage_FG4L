Running DataImportHandler unit tests emits a lot of console noise, mainly stacktraces because dataimport.properties can't be written. This makes it hard to scan the output for useful information.

I'm attaching a patch to get rid of most of the noise by creating the conf directory before test runs so that the properties file write doesn't fail.
