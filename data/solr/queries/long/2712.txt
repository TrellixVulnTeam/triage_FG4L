SOLR-2657 points out that all fields show up when you request score and something becides a 'normal' field.  To support the strange behavior and avoid it when uncenessary we have this:


    if( fields.size() == 1 && _wantsScore && augmenters.size() == 1 && globs.isEmpty() ) {
      _wantsAllFields = true;
    }



I suggest we advertise in 3.x that expecting fl=score to return all fields is deprecated, and remove this bit of crazy code from 4.x
