UniqFieldsUpdateProcessorFactory has been arround for a while, but if we change it to subclass FieldValueSubsetUpdateProcessorFactory, a lot of redundent code could be eliminated from that class, and the factory could be made more configurable by supporting all of the field matching logic in FieldMutatingUpdateProcessorFactory, not just a list of field names.

(the only new code that would be needed is handling the legacy config case currently supported by UniqFieldsUpdateProcessorFactory)

For users of 4.x starting with 4.5, the existing init param syntax will still be supported, but a warning will be logged recommending they switch to using <arr name="fieldName">...</arr> instead of <lst name="fields">..</lst>.  Starting with 5.0, the "fields" option won't be recognized at all.
