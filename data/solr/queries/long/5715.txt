When using CloudSolrServer to issue a request with a route param, the URLs passed to LBHttpSolrServer should be filtered to include only hosts serving a slice.  If there's a single shard listed, then the query can be served directly.  Otherwise, the cluster services 3 /select requests for the query.  As the host to replica ratio increases the probability of needing an extra hop goes to one, putting unnecessary strain on the cluster's network.
