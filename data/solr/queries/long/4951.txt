split off from SOLR-4942...


	add a new RandomMergePolicy that implements MergePolicy by proxying to another instance selected at creation using one of the LuceneTestCase.new...MergePolicy methods
	updated test configs to refer to this new MergePolicy
	borrow the "tests.shardhandler.randomSeed" logic in SolrTestCaseJ4 to give our RandomMergePolicy a consistent seed at runtime.
