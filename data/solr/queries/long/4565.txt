Norway has two official languages, both called "Norwegian", namely Bokmål (nb_NO) and Nynorsk (nn_NO).

The NorwegianMinimalStemFilter and NorwegianLightStemFilter today only works with the largest of the two, namely Bokmål.

Propose to incorporate "nn" support through a new "vaiant" config option:


	variant="nb" or not configured -> Bokmål as today
	variant="nn" -> Nynorsk only
	variant="no" -> Remove stems for both nb and nn
