The problem we saw was that splitting a shard with many segments and documents
failed by running out of heap space.

Increasing heap space so that all existing segments could be merged into one
overall segment does not seem practical. Running the split without segment
merging worked.

Could split always run without merging, or merge=true/false be an optional parameter for the SPLITSHARD action?
