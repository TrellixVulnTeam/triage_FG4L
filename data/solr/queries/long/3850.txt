CachedSqlEntityProcessor supports an obscure alternate to the "where" parameter.  Instead of <entity ... where='id=x.id' /> , users can use <entity ... cacheKey="id" cacheLookup="x.id" />  However, this was broken with SOLR-2382.  "cacheKey" was accidently renamed "cachePk".  For the sake of those who might be using this undocumented syntax and want to upgrade, I think it should be put back to "cacheKey".  Also, I will add documentation in the wiki.
