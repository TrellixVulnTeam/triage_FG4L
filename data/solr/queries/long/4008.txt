If remove the collection doesn't exist, any collection command will be failed after that.

The OverseerCollectionProcessor thread will be gone because the SolrException is run time exception. 

Thread is death that cause doesn't accept any command again. 

The worse case is the overall cloud create/delete collection will be failed, never recovery again except cleanup overseer collection queue in the zookeeper.
