Hi,

I'm a french user of SOLR and i've encountered a problem since i've installed SOLR 3.1.

I've got an error with this query : 
cle_frbr:"LYSROUGE1149-73190"

SEE COMMENTS BELOW

I've tested to escape the minus char and the query worked :
cle_frbr:"LYSROUGE1149(BACKSLASH)-73190"

But, strange fact, if i change one letter in my query it works :
cle_frbr:"LASROUGE1149-73190"


I've tested the same query on SOLR 1.4 and it works !

Can someone test the query on next line on a 3.1 SOLR version and tell me if he have the same problem ? 
yourfield:"LYSROUGE1149-73190"

Where do the problem come from ?

Thank you by advance for your help.

Tom
