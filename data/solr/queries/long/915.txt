In SolrCore: close() - all the way towards the end of the function - there seems to be a sequential list of close method invocation. 

    if( closeHooks != null ) {
       for( CloseHook hook : closeHooks ) 
{
         hook.close( this );
      }
    }

I believe this has scope to be parallelized ( actually the entire sequence of close operations , updateHandler,close() etc.) - by means of launching them in separate threads from an ExecutorService , for a much faster shutdown as the process definitely does not need to be sequential. 

This becomes all the more important in the multi-core context when we might want to shutdown and restart a SolrCore altogether.
