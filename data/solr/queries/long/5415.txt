If a core fails to load because of

	a bug in a new version of Solr
	or some config error



it immediately unregisters itself from ZK. This does not give the user a chance to rectify the error and restart the core/node . So if a core fails to load  it should not be unregistered from ZK unless an explicit core unload or a DELETEREPLICA collection command is inoked
