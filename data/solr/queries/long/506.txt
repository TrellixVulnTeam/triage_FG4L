HTTP cache headers are needed only for select handler's response and it does not make much sense to enable it globally for all Solr responses.

Therefore, enabling/disabling cache headers should be configurable on a per-handler basis. It should be enabled by default on the select request handler and disabled by default on all others. It should be possible to override these defaults through configuration as well as through API.
