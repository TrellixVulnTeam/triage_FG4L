This patch allows for the use of the new option 'rsyncd_bwlimit' in scripts.conf.

rsyncd_bwlimit adds  --bwlimit=XX to the rsyncd command line.  If the option is not specified bwlimit is set to 0 by default.

"       --bwlimit=KBPS
              This  option allows you to specify a maximum transfer rate in kilobytes per second. This option is most effective when using rsync with large files (several
              megabytes and up). Due to the nature of rsync transfers, blocks of data are sent, then if rsync determines the transfer was too fast, it  will  wait  before
              sending the next data block. The result is an average transfer rate equaling the specified limit. A value of zero specifies no limit."
