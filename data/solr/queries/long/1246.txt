StatsComponent use Double.MIN_VALUE when reseting its variables. Because of that, when calculating maximum value for negativ numbers max value will always return Double.MIN_VALUE because it is minimal positive value. Setting max value to Double.NEGATIV_INFINITY in reset method will resolve the problem. I can provide simple patch for this if needed.
