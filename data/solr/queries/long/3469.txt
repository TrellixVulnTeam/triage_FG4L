Hypothetical scenario:

	node comes up and needs to recover
	node starts buffering updates and replicating index
	node receives and buffers 1000 updates and dies before replication finishes
	node comes up, replays tlog
	peersync checks last 100 updates, they match, and node goes into "active" state (without having ever finished the index replication)
