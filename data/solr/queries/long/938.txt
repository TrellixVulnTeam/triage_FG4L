Adding a new feature that we need for continuation of a workflow based on a full-import procedure. When   a full-import completes , the pre-defined hook method is called at the end of the same. 

Implementations that need to notified , need to implement the new interface - DataImportCloseHook and register themselves in the data config file as follows. 

<dataConfig>

.
.
.
.
   <closeHook type="com.myorg.fullimporter.closeHookImpl1" />
   <closeHook type="com.myorg.fullimporter.closeHookImpl2" />
</dataConfig>

A single instance of them is created (as part of DataImporter) during instantiation and the same insance is reused across multiple invocations. 

Since the dataImporter is protected by a thread-lock - there is no thred-safe guarantee for the implementations of the full-import close hook.
