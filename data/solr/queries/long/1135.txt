when a request 

http://master_host:port/solr/replication?command=snapshoot

is made, a snapshot is created successfully but in a wrong directory. It is not in the data directory (like the script did) but in the directory where solr is launched. This creates complication to backup process because this makes the location of snapshot essential undefined, i.e. depends on how solr is launched.
