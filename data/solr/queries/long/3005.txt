i expect that query always return Content-Type, but after SOLR-1123 had committed, it got chance to return nothing if you leave out all of queryResponseWriter in solrconfig.xml. however i attach a small patch that will correct this situation.

It look like DEFAULT_RESPONSE_WRITERS never called init method in org.apache.solr.core.SolrCore
