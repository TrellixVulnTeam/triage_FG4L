As described in http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-numberformat/ instances of the NumberFormat class don't throw ParseExceptions in all cases of invalid input. This affects the org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.NumberFormatTransformer class which relies on NumberFormat. I will attach a patch to demonstrate and fix this issue shortly.
