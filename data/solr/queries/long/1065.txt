It is a common requirement to push data to DIH. Currently it is not possible . If we have a ContentStreamDataSource it can easily solve this problem

sample configuration


<dataSource type="ContentStreamDataSource"/>



This datasource does not need any extra configuration. Make a normal POST request with the data as the body. The params remain same.
