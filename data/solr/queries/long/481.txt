On some machines that have weird network settings, it is possible that InetAddress.getLocalHost() throws an UnknownHostException in _info.jsp in the admin console.  This prevents the entire admin console from coming up.  

The fix is to catch the exception and use a host string of "unknown host" or something to that effect.  

Patch shortly.
