Currently the EmbeddedSolrServer writes the response to XML (a string) then parses it so that it has an equivolent response to if it were passed around via HTTP.  We should:

	make this more efficient, or at least refactor so it is easy to make it more efficient in the future
	expose the parsing functions, so other components could use it directly.
