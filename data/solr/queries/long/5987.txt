CloudSolrServer currently references "collection" parameter using hard-coded string "collection", instead of using a constant field. This does not break anything, but is just general code cleanness issue. It is also harder to figure out how to specify a specific collection to send an update to without looking into CloudSolrServer source code. If it was using UpdateParams.COLLECTION constant, it would have been possible to look at UpdateParams JavaDoc to figure this out.
