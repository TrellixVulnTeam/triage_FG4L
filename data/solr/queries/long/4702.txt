The spellcheck links, AKA "Did you mean", aren't rendered correctly.

Instead of just having the corrected words, they have some .toString gibberish because the object being serialized is too high up in the tree.

This breaks both the link text displayed to the user, and the href used for the anchor tag.

Example:
Search for "electronicss OR monitor" and you get:
Did you mean {collationQuery=electronics OR monitor,hits=14,misspellingsAndCorrections={electronicss=electronics,monitor=monitor}}?

But you should just see:
Did you mean electronics OR monitor?   (with hyperlinked "electronics OR monitor")

The actual query submitted by those links is similarly broken.  Possibly the templates were developed before collation was added and/or enabled by default.

To see this bug at all with the example configs and docs you'll need to have applied SOLR-4680 or SOLR-4681 against 4.2 or trunk.
