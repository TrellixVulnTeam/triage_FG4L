I've occasionally gone to demo multicore and stubbed my toe on how to fire it up...  Such a little thing, but I check the ./example/multicore/README.txt file and there aren't any directions!   And off to the wiki I go!

This tiny little patch just says what the -Dsolr.solr.home parameter should be!
