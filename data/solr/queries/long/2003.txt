ResourceLoader is used to load things like stopwords and synonyms files, but it uses the default 'Charset' argument for this.

when you open an InputStream with a Charset, you get:


decoder = charset.newDecoder().onMalformedInput(
    CodingErrorAction.REPLACE).onUnmappableCharacter(
    CodingErrorAction.REPLACE);



For cases like malformed encoded stopwords and synonyms files, I think its more helpful to use CodingErrorAction.REPORT than to silently replace with a replacement char. Then the user gets an exception.
