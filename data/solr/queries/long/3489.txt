If the listing of configuration files that should be replicated contains a space, the following file is not replicated.
Example:


<!-- The error in the configuration is the space before stopwords.txt.
     Because of that that file is not replicated -->
<str name="confFiles">schema.xml,test.txt, stopwords.txt</str>



It would be nice, if that space simply would be ignored.
