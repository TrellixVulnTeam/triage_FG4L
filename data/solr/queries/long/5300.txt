Currently, shards can only be split at the mid point of their hash range. This makes it difficult to control the distribution of data in the sub shards.

We should make it possible to specify ranges to be used for splitting. A ranges parameter can be added which can accept hash ranges in hexadecimal e.g. ranges=0-1f4,1f5-3e8,3e9-5dc will split a shard with range 0-1500 into three shards with ranges [0,500], [501-1000] and [1001-1500] respectively.
