If two or more tokens are in a position column, and there is a larger position column somewhere else, the empty space won't be filled in correctly, resulting in tokens displayed in the wrong positions.

simple example:
a=>b,c
q=>x,y,z

then analyze "a q" and the first column will contain "b","c","z"
