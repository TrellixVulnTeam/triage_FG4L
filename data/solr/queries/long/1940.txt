o.a.s.h.SolrDispatchFilter can set the output Content-Type to a null pointer instead of a string. Under websphere this results in a NullPointerException. This is the offending code: 

    response.setContentType(responseWriter.getContentType(solrReq, solrRsp));

Suggested fix: either use a default content type, or do not set the content type and let the browser handle it.
