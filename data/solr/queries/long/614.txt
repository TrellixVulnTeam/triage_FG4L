All the components initialized by Solr have an init(NamedList args) initializer. This leads us to writing the configuration needed for the component in the NamedList xml format. People familiar with Solr may know the format but most of what is written is noise than information. For users who are not familiar w/ the format find it too difficult to understand why they have to write it this way. Moreover , it is not a very efficient way to configure .
