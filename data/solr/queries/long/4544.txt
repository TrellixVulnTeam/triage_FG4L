I would like to have a custom ShardHandlerFactory, which has my own special load balancing logic (among other things).  The HttpShardHandler is what currently handles the parallelization of shard requests.  I would like to reuse it, but it expects package private variables in HttpShardHandlerFactory which it can reach back into for making load balancer requests and a completion service.
