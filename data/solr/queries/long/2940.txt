Future versions of Carrot2 clustering algorithms may be able to take some non-textual fields into account to change the characteristics of clusters. Preparing for this feature, the clustering component should be able to pass values for the custom fields. Custom field mappings would be configured using one or more carrot.custom parameters, each specifying a mapping in the form of: <solr-field-name>:<carrot2-field-name>.
