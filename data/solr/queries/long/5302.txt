This ticket is to track a "replacement" for the StatsComponent. The AnalyticsComponent supports the following features:


	All functionality of StatsComponent (SOLR-4499)
	Field Faceting (SOLR-3435)
	
		Support for limit
		Sorting (bucket name or any stat in the bucket
		Support for offset
	
	
	Range Faceting
	
		Supports all options of standard range faceting
	
	
	Query Faceting (SOLR-2925)
	Ability to use overall/field facet statistics as input to range/query faceting (ie calc min/max date and then facet over that range
	Support for more complex aggregate/mapping operations (SOLR-1622)
	
		Aggregations: min, max, sum, sum-of-square, count, missing, stddev, mean, median, percentiles
		Operations: negation, abs, add, multiply, divide, power, log, date math, string reversal, string concat
		Easily pluggable framework to add additional operations
	
	
	New / cleaner output format



Outstanding Issues:

	Multi-value field support for stats (supported for faceting)
	Multi-shard support (may not be possible for some operations, eg median)
