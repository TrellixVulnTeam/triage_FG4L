bit mask values are now package protected, so we have to duplicate:


  final static int INDEXED             = 0x00000001;
  final static int TOKENIZED           = 0x00000002;
  final static int STORED              = 0x00000004;
  final static int BINARY              = 0x00000008;
  final static int OMIT_NORMS          = 0x00000010;
  ...


to set these fields explicitly.  This is important for complex fields like LatLonType and poly fields in general
