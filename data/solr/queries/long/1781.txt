We had the same problem as someone described in http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-solr-user/201001.mbox/%3c222A518D-DDF5-4FC8-A02A-74D4F232B339@snooth.com%3e. A partial copy of that message:

We're using the new replication and it's working pretty well. There's  
one detail I'd like to get some more information about.

As the replication works, it creates versions of the index in the data  
directory. Originally we had index/, but now there are dated versions  
such as index.20100127044500/, which are the replicated versions.

Each copy is sized in the vicinity of 65G. With our current hard drive  
it's fine to have two around, but 3 gets a little dicey. Sometimes  
we're finding that the replication doesn't always clean up after  
itself. I would like to understand this better, or to not have this  
happen. It could be a configuration issue.
