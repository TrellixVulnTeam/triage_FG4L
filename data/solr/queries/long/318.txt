http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/solr/trunk/example/solr/conf/schema.xml  just after <fields> has a list of "Valid attributes for fields", although required is not mentioned there.  default is explained in a later example.  Perhaps that explanation should be moved to the list instead of next to it's first usage so it's more consistent.  i.e.

   <!-- Valid attributes for fields:
     name: mandatory - the name for the field
     type: mandatory - the name of a previously defined type from the <types> section
     indexed: true if this field should be indexed (searchable or sortable)
     stored: true if this field should be retrievable
     required: <ADD SOME DESCRIPTION HERE>
     compressed: [false] if this field should be stored using gzip compression
       (this will only apply if the field type is compressable; among
       the standard field types, only TextField and StrField are)
     multiValued: true if this field may contain multiple values per document
     omitNorms: (expert) set to true to omit the norms associated with
       this field (this disables length normalization and index-time
       boosting for the field, and saves some memory).  Only full-text
       fields or fields that need an index-time boost need norms.
     termVectors: [false] set to true to store the term vector for a given field.
       When using MoreLikeThis, fields used for similarity should be stored for 
       best performance.
     default: "default" values can be specified for fields, indicating which
        value should be used if no value is specified when adding a document.
