Currently there are two options for how to handle commiting documents:
1. the client explicitly starts the commit via <commit/>
2. set an auto commit value on the server â€“ clients can assume all documents will be commited within that time.

However, this does not help in the case where the clients know what documents need updating quickly and others that could wait.  I suggest adding:


 <add commitWithin="100">...

 

to the update syntax so the client can schedule commits explicitly.
