When a Solr instance that is not part of the quorum tries to start the Solr Zk server, no zkRun is set, and if not using localhost for the host, the ZK server fails to start as we cannot match it with any URL in the zkHost string. We shouldn't be trying to start the Zk Server at all - some bug that snuck in and was not spotted earlier because it didn't manifest in Solr not starting when using localhost addresses.
