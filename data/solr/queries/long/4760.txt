Some log messages could be more informative. For example:



680 [coreLoadExecutor-3-thread-3] WARN org.apache.solr.schema.IndexSchema  â€“ schema has no name!



Would be very nice to know which core this is complaining about.
Later, once the core is loaded, the core name shows up in the logs,
but it would be nice to have it earlier without having to
triangulating it through 'Loading core' messages.
