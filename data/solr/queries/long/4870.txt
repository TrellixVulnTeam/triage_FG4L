Speaking about the update log - i have noticed a strange behavior concerning
the replay. The replay is supposed to be done for a predefined number of
log entries, but actually it is always done for the whole last 2 tlogs.
RecentUpdates.update() reads log within  while (numUpdates <
numRecordsToKeep), while numUpdates is never incremented, so it exits when
the reader reaches EOF.
