The counters timesFailed and replicationFailedAtList on slave replication details page indicate errors on every poll, but in log file there is only:
INFO: Slave in sync with master.

This happens until the first real replication of files.

I tracked things down and it seems that in SnapPuller.java the "successfulInstall" is initialized with false and not set to true when indexes are in sync.

I'll attach a small patch (untested).
