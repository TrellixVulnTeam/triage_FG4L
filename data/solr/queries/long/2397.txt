the main solconfig.xml example file has gotten cluttered, doesn't use consistent indenting, lists various things in a haphazard order, and contains relics of outdated/deprecated plugins/terminology.  this really needs to be dealt with prior to 3.1 since most people reuse this example as the basis for their own configs.

rather then trying to opening individual issues for little one off changes (which is how a lot of the haphazard came about) i'm going to take a stab at one big cleanup here and seek feedback on the end result
