The link to the Jenkins-built Lucene javadocs used by Solr's "javadoc" target no longer works.

From https://builds.apache.org/job/Lucene-Solr-tests-only-trunk/8811/consoleText :


  [javadoc] javadoc: warning - Error fetching URL: https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Lucene-trunk/javadoc/all/package-list
...
BUILD FAILED
/usr/home/hudson/hudson-slave/workspace/Lucene-Solr-tests-only-trunk/checkout/solr/build.xml:213: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/usr/home/hudson/hudson-slave/workspace/Lucene-Solr-tests-only-trunk/checkout/solr/common-build.xml:389: Javadocs warnings were found!



The link should instead be https://builds.apache.org/job/Lucene-trunk/javadoc/all/package-list
