Since SOLR-2438, we can support localized rangequeries if someone has (ICU)CollationKeyFilter in the chain.

I think it might be best to add these automagically, because if you use these filters then not analyzing
with them just means stuff doesn't work at all, since the terms are represented as collation keys.

In trunk this already works, because (ICU)CollationField takes care of it.
