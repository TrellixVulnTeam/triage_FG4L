Some web application servers (e.g., IBM WebSphere application server) do not have a default welcome file list.  The Solr servlet and related JSPs currently depend upon a default welcome file list.  Adding a welcome-file-list entry to web.xml will rectify this problem in a compatible way:

<welcome-file-list>
  <welcome-file>index.jsp</welcome-file>
</welcome-file-list>
