The ReplicationHandler "details" command reports that replication failed when it didn't.  This occurs after a slave is restarted when it is already in sync with the master.  This makes it difficult to write production monitors that check the health of master-slave replication (no network issues, unexpected slowdowns, etc).

From the code, it looks like "SnapPuller.successfulInstall" starts out false on restart.  If the slave starts out in sync with the master, then each no-op replication poll leaves "successfulInstall" set to false which makes SnapPuller.logReplicationTimeAndConfFiles log the poll as a failure.  SnapPuller.successfulInstall stays false until the first time replication actually has to do something, at which point it gets set to true, and then everything is OK.

Steps to reproduce

	Setup Solr master and slave servers using Solr 1.4 Java replication.
	Index some content on the master.  Wait for it to replicate through to the slave so the master and slave are in sync.
	Stop the slave server.
	Restart the slave server.
	Wait for the first slave replication poll.
	Query the replication status using "http://localhost:8983/solr/replication?command=details"
	Until the master index changes and there's something to replicate, all slave replication polls after the restart will be shown as failed in the XML response.
