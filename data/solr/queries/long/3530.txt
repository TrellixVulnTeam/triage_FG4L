spin off from SOLR-3258, it would be helpful if SolrJ, when encountering Exceptions from the ResponseParser (or perhaps before ever even handing data to the ResponseParser) did some validation of the Content-Type returned by the remote server to give better error messages in cases where miss configuration has the wrong matchup between ResponseParser and mime-type (or worse: an HTML page being returned by a non-solr server)
