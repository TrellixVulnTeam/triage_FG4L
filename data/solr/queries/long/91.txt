If the commit frequency is high, and searcher warming configured, sometimes an overlap of warming searchers can occur.  Solr currently detects this and logs a warning message.

While normally relatively harmless, multiple warming searchers can sometimes cause thrashing, extending the time it takes to complete warming, and causing a chain reaction where more and more searchers try to warm concurrently.
