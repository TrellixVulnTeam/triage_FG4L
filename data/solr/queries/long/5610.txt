Add a collection admin API for cluster wide property management
the new API would create an entry in the root as 
/cluster-props.json


{
"prop":val"
}



The API would work as

/command=clusterprop&name=propName&value=propVal

there will be a set of well-known properties which can be set or unset with this command
