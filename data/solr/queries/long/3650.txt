There was discussion a long while back about eliminating the plethora of CHANGES.txt files in various lucene contribs/modules and consolidating into lucene/CHANGES.txt to prevent "hiding" things from users who may not know/think/remember to check each of the individual contirbs/modules.

this is long done and dealt with under "lucene/", but on the "solr/" side we still have a multitude of CHANGES.txt files in contribs that are inconsistently used to record features/fixes in those contribs (frequently they get listed in solr/CHANGES.txt instead)

We should eliminate these contrib/*/CHANGES.txt files completely, and merge all of the existing items in them into the apropriate version & section of solr/CHANGES.txt


hossman@frisbee:~/lucene/dev$ find -name CHANGES.txt
./solr/CHANGES.txt
./solr/contrib/langid/CHANGES.txt
./solr/contrib/dataimporthandler/CHANGES.txt
./solr/contrib/clustering/CHANGES.txt
./solr/contrib/extraction/CHANGES.txt
./solr/contrib/uima/CHANGES.txt
./solr/contrib/analysis-extras/CHANGES.txt
./lucene/CHANGES.txt
