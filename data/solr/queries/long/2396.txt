In LUCENE-2551 collation support was changed to use byte[] keys.

Previously it encoded sort keys with IndexableBinaryString into char[],
but this is wasteful with regards to RAM and disk when terms can be byte.

A better solution would be [ICU]CollationFieldTypes, as this would also allow locale-sensitive range queries.
