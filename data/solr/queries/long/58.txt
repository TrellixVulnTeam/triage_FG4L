I need to expose the admin functionality to an external application.  I think returning admin data as XML may be a good and simple first step towards that.

To do that I think I'll mostly need to modify JSPs (but I haven't had a good look at Admin GUI yet).  From what I saw a few weeks ago when I briefly looked at this, no Java code will need to be modified.  If you have concrete ideas about how this should be done, please comment before I start next week (week of October 23rd 2006).
