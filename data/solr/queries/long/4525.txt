It's apparent that some different environments are giving me fits, I'll try to clean them up all at once.

OpenCloseCoreStressTest is failing on 32-bit JVMs
TestSolrProperties fails (Windows) with:
Unable to delete file: .\org.apache.solr.core.TestSolrProperties\solrHome\solr.properties

Test fails part of the time in that environment. Attached patch will turn on some verbose logging to try to understand what's going on.
