We should be able to create a collection where sharding is done based on the value of a given field

collections can be created with shardField=fieldName, which will be persisted in DocCollection in ZK

implicit DocRouter would look at this field instead of shard field

CompositeIdDocRouter can also use this field instead of looking at the id field.
