As part of SOLR-4952 SpellCheckCollatorTest started using RandomMergePolicy, and this (aparently) led to a failure in testEstimatedHitCounts.

As far as i can tell: the test assumes that specific values would be returned as the estimated "hits" for a colleation, and it appears that the change in MergePolicy however resulted in different segments with different term stats, causing the estimation code to produce different values then what is expected.

I made a quick attempt to improve the test to:

	expect explicit exact values only when spellcheck.collateMaxCollectDocs is set such that the "estimate' should actually be exact (ie: collateMaxCollectDocs  == 0 or collateMaxCollectDocs greater then the num docs in the index
	randomize the values used for collateMaxCollectDocs and confirm that the estimates are never more then the num docs in the index



This lead to an odd "ArithmeticException: / by zero" error in the test, which seems to suggest that there is a genuine bug in the code for estimating the hits that only gets tickled in certain mergepolicy/segment/collateMaxCollectDocs combinations.

Update: This appears to be a general problem with collecting docs out of order and the estimation of hits â€“ i believe even if there is no divide by zero error, the estimates are largely meaningless since the docs are collected out of order.
