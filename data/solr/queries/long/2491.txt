If specifying "spellcheck.maxCollationTries" and "group=true" on the same query, you never get any Spell Check Collations back.  The problem is that SpellCheckCollator relies on ResponseBuilder.getToLog().get("hits") to see how many results each test query returns.  When "group=true", the "toLog" isn't populated so SpellCheckCollator is unable to find a collation that can return results.
