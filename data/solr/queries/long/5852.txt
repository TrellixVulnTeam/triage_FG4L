We should have a CloudSolrServer constructor which takes a list of ZK servers to connect to.

Something Like 

public CloudSolrServer(String... zkHost);




	Document the current constructor better to mention that to connect to a ZK ensemble you can pass a comma-delimited list of ZK servers like
zk1:2181,zk2:2181,zk3:2181




	Thirdly should getLbServer() and getZKStatereader() be public?
