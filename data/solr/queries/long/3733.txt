Just an issue to try to improve the stuff mentioned in SOLR-3690.

Currently there is one directory api/ which is 'all javadocs'
then solrj javadocs are duplicated again under api/solrj
now also test-framework is underneath.

But this isnt very navigable, and these additional folders
(duplicate or not) are hidden behind the index.html on the website.

we can improve this and probably generate a landing page from
the build.xml descriptions etc like Lucene.
