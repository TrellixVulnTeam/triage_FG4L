If the coreRootDirectory setting does not end with a filesystem path separator, cores are not created in the correct location.

e.g.
coreRootDirectory=/usr/local/solr/cores

For a collection xyz, API creates '/usr/local/solr/coresxyz_shardN_replicaN' config directory instead of '/usr/local/solr/cores/xyz_shardN_replicaN' 

Adding a trailing slash to coreRootDirectory is a viable workaround:

coreRootDirectory=/usr/local/solr/cores/
