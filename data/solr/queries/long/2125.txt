The calculations of distance appears to be off.

Note: "The radius of the sphere to be used when calculating distances on a sphere (i.e. haversine). Default is the Earth's mean radius in kilometers (see org.apache.solr.search.function.distance.Constants.EARTH_MEAN_RADIUS_KM) which is set to 3,958.761458084784856. Most applications will not need to set this."

The radius of the earth in KM is  6371.009 km (â‰ˆ3958.761 mi).

Also filtering distance appears to be off - example data:

45.17614,-93.87341 to 44.9369054,-91.3929348 Approx 137 miles Google. 169 miles = 220 kilometers

Nothing shows. d=285 shows results. This is off by a lot.
