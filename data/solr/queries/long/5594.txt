Enable users to be able to use prefix query with custom field types with non-default encoding/decoding for queries more easily. e.g. having a custom field work with base64 encoded query strings.

Currently, the workaround for it is to have the override at getRewriteMethod level. Perhaps having the prefixQuery also use the calling FieldType's readableToIndexed method would work better.
