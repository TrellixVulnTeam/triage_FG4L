Currently DIH fails completely on any error. We must have better control on error behavior

mail thread: http://markmail.org/message/xvfbfaskfmlj2pnm

an entity can have an attribute onError the values can be abort, continue,skip

abort is the default . It aborts the import. continue or skip does not fail the import it continues from there. skip skips all rows in an xml (only if stream != true)if there is an error in xml but continues with the next xml.
