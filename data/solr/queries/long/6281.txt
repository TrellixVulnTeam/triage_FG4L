The DefaultSolrHighlighter (works on non-FVH and FVH modes) and PostingsSolrHighlighter are quite different, although they do share some highlighting parameters where it's directly applicable.  DSH has its fragListBuilder, fragmentsBuilder, boundaryScanner, configurable by letting you defined your own class in solrconfig.xml.  PSH does not; it uses the Lucene default implementations of DefaultPassageFormatter, PassageScorer, and Java BreakIterator, though it configures each of them based on options. I have a case where I need to provide a custom PassageFormatter, for example.
