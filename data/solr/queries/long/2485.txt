In SOLR-1566, we dramatically refactored the response writer framework â€“ BaseResponseWriter, GenericBinaryResponseWriter, and GenericTextResponseWriter got left out in the cold because they don't have any tests and it is unclear how they are supposed to work.  With the new refactoring, I think the goals of these classes are better supported by extending BinaryResponseWriter and TextResponseWriter.

in 3.x, these classes  should be deprecated and suggest using BinaryResponseWriter and TextResponseWriter
