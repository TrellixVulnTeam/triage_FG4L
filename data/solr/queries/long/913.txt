In the class -  org.apache.solr.handler.SnapPuller - there seems to be an expensive Pattern object created locally in the method 

  static Integer readInterval(String interval) ; 

Pattern instances are better created as static objects and reused.

The same is true for HttpClient instances. These are one per core right now. We can make that static too.
