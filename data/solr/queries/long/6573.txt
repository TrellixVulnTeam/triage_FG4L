Elevation does not work when localParams are specified.
In example collection1 shipped with Solr query like this one 

http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/elevate?q=ipod&fl=id,title,[elevated]

 properly returns elevated documents on top.

If localParams are specified e.g. 
{!q.op=AND}
 in query like 

http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/elevate?q=\{!q.op=AND\}ipod&fl=id,title,[elevated]

documents are not elevated anymore.
