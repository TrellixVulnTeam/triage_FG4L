This patch fixes the saving of commit points during backup operations.

This fixes the perviously commited (for 1.4) SOLR-1475 patch.

1. In IndexDeletionPolicyWrapper.java, commit points are not saved to the 'savedCommits' map.
2. Also, the testing of the presence of a commit point uses the contains() method instead of containsKey().

The result of this means that backups for anything but toy indexes fail, because the commit points are deleted (after 10s) before the full backup is completed.

This patch addresses these 2 issues.

Tested with 1.4.1 release trunk, but should also work fine with 1.4.
