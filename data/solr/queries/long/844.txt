Currently a CommonsHttpSolrServer can talk to only one server. This demands that the user have a LoadBalancer or do the roundrobin on their own. We must have a LBHttpSolrServer which must automatically do a Loadbalancing between multiple hosts. This can be backed by the CommonsHttpSolrServer



This can have the following other features


	Automatic failover
	Optionally take in  a file /url containing the the urls of servers so that the server list can be automatically updated  by periodically loading the config
	Support for adding removing servers during runtime
	Pluggable Loadbalancing mechanism. (round-robin, weighted round-robin, random etc)
	Pluggable Failover mechanisms
