Improvements to HTMLStripHighlighter:


	fix padding of hexadecimal entities (currently off by 1)
	add an option not to emit padding at all. In certain applications padding emitted after entities such as รณ may split words that are in fact single terms.
	add entities that are recognized when written all in uppercase and recognized by browsers.
