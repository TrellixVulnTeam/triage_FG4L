In eclipse, its currently difficult to get a solr development environment working.

One big thing that would help would be to make it easier to run the tests.
When loading resources, if we checked the config dir + file directory from the resource path,
then users could simply add src/test/test-files to their eclipse build classpath, and tests would just work from the IDE.

I gather that this might make things easier for other IDEs too, though I'm aware that ones like Intellij
let you configure the test 'working directory' on a project basis, but eclipse doesn't 
(you have to make a custom run configuration every time you run the tests)
