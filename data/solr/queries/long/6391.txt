Right now, a create collection call that looks like:

  ?action=CREATE&name=c1&collection.configname=myconf

returns an error about numShards being a 'required' parameter. We should mention in the message about it being optional in case of compositeId router.
This would get things to be on the same page as the documentation and make it less confusing for users.
