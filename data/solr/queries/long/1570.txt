When loading a new schema, Solr should log some "SEVERE" warnings if the schema uses a uniqueKey field, but that field/type don't match the expected needs of unieuqKey field for most functionality to work (stored=true, multiValued=false) ... that way people won't (have any reason to) be suprised when things break later)
