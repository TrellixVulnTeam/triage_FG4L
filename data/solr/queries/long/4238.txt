This is being used now:
                <Set name="filenameDateFormat">yyyy_mm_dd</Set>
but mm means minutes (I guess) and filenames created are not meaningfull. Changing to 
                <Set name="filenameDateFormat">yyyy_MM_dd</Set>
creates proper filenames.

Note that the logger is commented out by default, but I always enable it.
