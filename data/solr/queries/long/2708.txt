The mechanism for getting beans is rather limited - only classes @Field-annotated fields.

Imaging the following subprojects:

	common
	search



And you want to reuse a class from common as a result from a solr search. You should either duplicate the structure or make common depend on solrj. Neither are desirable.

So, my suggestion:

	introduce a pluggable mechanism for bean resolution. Currently it is impossible - it uses private methods and private inner classes. (This will be useful for custom conversions, because the existing one fails in some cases where BeanUtils.copyProperties works.)
	allow externalized (xml) configuration
	allow detecting all fields, annotated or not (off by default)
