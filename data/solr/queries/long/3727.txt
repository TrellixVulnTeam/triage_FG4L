I added AwaitsFix and BadApple to AbstractFullDistribZkTestBase which currently disables a bunch of tests inheriting from it. Some of them leave behind threads that look suspicious to me. It must be possible to clean up zookeeper somehow so that we don't have inter-test dependencies.

I would also like to run for a day or two without these tests to see how it affects ci builds (see what else may be causing problems).
