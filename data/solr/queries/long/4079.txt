Our data is split up over multiple cores with automatic naming, typically of the form "articles_20080101154402_20080412181644". With long names like that, the sidebar will massively overshoot its boundaries and intrude so far into the main pane that it interferes with UI inputs and controls.

Fixing this issue is trivial even within the browser, by introducing a custom stylesheet.
