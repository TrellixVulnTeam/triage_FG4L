The example schema should use the lucene core PorterStemmer (coded in Java by Martin Porter)
 instead of the Snowball one that is auto-generated code.

Although we have sped up the Snowball stemmer, its still pretty slow and the example should be fast.

Below is the output of ant test -Dtestcase=TestIndexingPerformance -Dargs="-server -Diter=100000"
These results are consistent with large document indexing times that I have seen on large english
collections with Lucene, we double indexing speed.
