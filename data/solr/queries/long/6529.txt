Currently the stop command looks for all running Solr instances and stops those. I feel this is a bit dangerous.

When starting a process with the start command we could write out a pid file of the solr process that it started. Then the stop script should stop that process.

It could error out if the pid file is not present.

We could still keep the feature of stopping all solr nodes by passing passing -all ?
