When calling the luke request handler with the provided luke.xsl XSLT stylesheet (admin/luke?wt=xslt&tr=luke.xsl), non-ASCII characters are displayed as question marks . Setting a media type with proper character encoding (media-type="text/xml; charset=UTF-8") in the <xsl:output> section solves this problem.
