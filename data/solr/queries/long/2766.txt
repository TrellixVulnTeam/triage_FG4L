I was updating Solr's web site with the 3.4.0 release, but suddenly
discovered that the javadocs for the test-framework and solrj (linked
under the Documentation tab on the left) are missing from
apache-solr-3.4.0.tgz.

Ie, when I "tar xzf" that, then:


find . -name index.html
./docs/index.html
./docs/api/index.html



(3.3.0's tgz does include them)

I think this is just a packaging problem (maybe from the recent
renaming?); I see their javadocs under solr/build/solr-solrj/docs/api
and solr/build/solr-test-framework/docs/api.

I also see seprate javadocs for all solr contribs... are these
supposed to be published on the web site?

For now I've just copied up the solrj and test-framework jdocs, built
from the 3.4 branch, to the site.  But we should fix this for
3.5.0....
