The DocumentBuilder addField methods have different semantics based on whether you are passing in the field name as a String or the SchemaField.  Passing in the SchemaField does not handle copyField, whereas passing in the field name does.  Go figure.  Doesn't make sense to me, but we should at least document what is happening.
