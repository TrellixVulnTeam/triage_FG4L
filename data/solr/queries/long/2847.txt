In Trunk, the IndexBasedSpellChecker dictionary is not being built both for the "control" and "shard" indexes.  The test then compares nothing to nothing and passes, because both the shard-index response and the control-index responses are the same.  This issue fixes the problem with the dictionaries not being built and also adds an additional check for data in the control-index responses so that this sort of regression may be detected in the future.
