The existing PhoneticFilter allows for use of the DoubleMetaphone encoder. However, it doesn't expose the maxCodeLength() setting, and it ignores the alternate encodings that the encoder provides for some words. This new filter is not as generic as the PhoneticFilter, but allows more detailed control over the DoubleMetaphone encoder.
