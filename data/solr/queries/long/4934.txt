	LUCENE-5038 eliminated setUseCompoundFile(boolean) from the built in MergePolicies
	existing users may have configs that use <mergePolicy> init args to try and call that setter
	we already do some explicit checks for these MergePolices in SolrIndexConfig to deal with legacy syntax
	update the existing logic to remove "useCompoundFile" from the MergePolicy initArgs for these known policies if found, and log a warning.



(NOTE: i don't want to arbitrarily remove "useCompoundFile" from the initArgs regardless of class in case someone has a custom MergePolicy that implements that logic â€“ that would suck)
