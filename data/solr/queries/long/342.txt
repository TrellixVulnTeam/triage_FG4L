LUCENE-843 adds support for new indexing capabilities using the setRAMBufferSizeMB() method that should significantly speed up indexing for many applications.  To fix this, we will need trunk version of Lucene (or wait for the next official release of Lucene)

Side effect of this is that Lucene's new, faster StandardTokenizer will also be incorporated.  

Also need to think about how we want to incorporate the new merge scheduling functionality (new default in Lucene is to do merges in a background thread)
