According to:
http://www.nabble.com/WordDelimiterFilter%2BLenghtFilter-results-in-termPosition%3D%3D-1-td16306788.html

org.apache.solr.analysis.LengthFilter seems not used, as org.apache.solr.analysis.LengthFilterFactory correctly wraps around org.apache.lucene.analysis.LengthFilter, and not org.apache.solr.analysis.LengthFilter, so perhaps the latter could be deprecated
