in SOLR-4942 i updated every solrconfig.xml to either...


	include solrconfig.snippet.randomindexconfig.xml where it was easy to do so
	use the useCompoundFile sys prop if it already had an <indexConfig> section, or if including the snippet wasn't going to be easy (ie: contrib tests)



As an improvment on this:


	audit all core configs not already using solrconfig.snippet.randomindexconfig.xml and either:
	
		make them use it, ignoring any previously unimportant explicit incdexConfig settings
		make them use it, using explicit sys props to overwrite random values in cases were explicit indexConfig values are important for test
		add a comment why it's not using the include snippet in cases where the explicit parsing is part of hte test
