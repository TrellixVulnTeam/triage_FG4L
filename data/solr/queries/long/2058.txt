... my results might  be even better if I had a couple different "pf2"s with different "ps"'s  at the same time.   In particular.   One with ps=0 to put a high boost on ones the have  the right ordering of words.  For example insuring that [the query]:
  "red hat black jacket"
 boosts only documents with "red hats" and not "black hats".   And another pf2 with a more modest boost with ps=5 or so to handle the query above also boosting docs with 
  "red baseball hat".

Perhaps fold it into the pf/pf2 syntax?

pf=text^2    // current syntax... makes phrases with a boost of 2
pf=text~1^2  // proposed syntax... makes phrases with a slop of 1 and
a boost of 2

That actually seems pretty natural given the lucene query syntax - an
actual boosted sloppy phrase query already looks like
text:"foo bar"~1^2

Big +1 to this idea ... the existing "ps" param can stick arround as the 
default for any field that doesn't specify it's own slop in the pf/pf2/pf3 
fields using the "~" syntax.
