Using 4.0 trunk version as of 3/16/2011

Not sure at which point in the 4.0 trunk did this problem happen but this did not happen in previous versions.

Symptom:

1) Assume you have a search db with a query for "love" that returns 500 results.
2) Append "&sort=anyfield desc" to the search query and you now only get 1 result back.

I even rebuilt the db from scratch to make sure it was not a corrupted solr db but that is not the case.

Temporary Fix:

1) Append ",score desc" to the "sort" value such as "&sort=anyfield desc,score desc" fixes the issue and gives back the correct result.
