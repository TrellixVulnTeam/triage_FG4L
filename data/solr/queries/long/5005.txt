A user customizable script based request handler would be very useful.  It's inspired from the ScriptUpdateRequestProcessor, but on the search end. A user could write a script that submits searches to Solr (in-VM) and can react to the results of one search before making another that is formulated dynamically.  And it can assemble the response data, potentially reducing both the latency and data that would move over the wire if this feature didn't exist.  It could also be used to easily add a user-specifiable search API at the Solr server with request parameters governed by what the user wants to advertise â€“ especially useful within enterprises.  And, it could be used to enforce security requirements on allowable parameter valuables to Solr, so a javascript based Solr client could be allowed to talk to only a script based request handler which enforces the rules.
