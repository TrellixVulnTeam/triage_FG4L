The idea was to create a new, fresh (and hopefully clean) Solr Admin Interface. [Based on this ML-Thread]

Features:

	Dashboard
	Query-Form
	Plugins
	Analysis (SOLR-2476, SOLR-2400)
	Schema-Browser
	Dataimport (SOLR-2482)
	Core-Admin
	Replication
	Zookeeper
	Logging (SOLR-2459)
	
		Stub (using static data)
	
	



Newly created Wiki-Page: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/ReworkedSolrAdminGUI

I've quickly created a Github-Repository (Just for me, to keep track of the changes)
