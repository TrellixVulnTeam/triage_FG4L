I noticed a randomized failure in MapReduceIndexerToolArgumentParserTest which is reproducible with any seed – all that matters is the locale.

The problem sounded familiar, and a quick search verified that jenkins has in fact hit this a couple of times in the past – Uwe commented on the list that this is due to a real problem in one of the third-party dependencies (that does the argument parsing) that will affect usage on some systems.

If working around the bug in the arg parsing lib isn't feasible, MapReduceIndexerTool should fail cleanly if the locale isn't one we know is "supported"
