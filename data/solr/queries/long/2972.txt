In JoinQParserPlugin.java, the method createParser builds a QParser like this:

QParser fromQueryParser = subQuery(v, "lucene");

This prevent us from using this syntax to select a query parser for the join operation:
qf=text name
q=
{!join from=manu_id_s to=id defType=dismax}
ipod

As a workaround, we can use var dereferencing:
qf=text name
q=
{!join from=manu_id_s to=id v=$qq}
qq=
{!dismax}
ipod

But according to Hoss, just replacing the hardcoded "lucene" with null should allow to use the first syntax.
