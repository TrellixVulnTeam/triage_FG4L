There has been at least one report of an early-adopter having replication (as in master/slave) configured with SolrCloud and having very odd results. Experienced Solr users could reasonably try this (or just have their configurations from 3.x Solr installations hanging around). Since SolrCloud takes this functionality over completely, it seems like replication needs to be made smart enough to disable itself if running under SolrCloud.
