LUCENE-2446 added checksums to Lucene segment files. We could expose CheckIntegrityAtMerge in the indexConfig tag in solrconfig.xml.
Something like - 

     <!--
		Use true to enable this safety check, which can help
   		reduce the risk of propagating index corruption from older segments 
   		into new ones, at the expense of slower merging.
     -->
     <checkIntegrityAtMerge>false</checkIntegrityAtMerge>
