To both encourage good internal development, and to make it easy for plugin developers to write unit tests of their own code I think we need a harness that makes it easy to unit test updates and queries against Solr (without needing a servlet container)

Once we have this, i think we can/should also retire "TestApp" in favor of some JUnit tests (which would probably make more sense for other developers)


Iv'e already started on this, i thought i'd have something to commit tonight, but i got distracted ... filing this bug as a tracker for now.
