The splitshard api doesn't call commit on new sub shards but it happily sets them to active state which means on a successful split, the documents are not visible to searchers unless an explicit commit is called on the cluster.

The coreadmin split api will still not call commit on targetCores. That is by design and we're not going to change that.
