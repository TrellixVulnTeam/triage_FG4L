David (me) and Eric's latest book, "Apache Solr 3 Enterprise Search Server", was just published by Packt.  http://www.packtpub.com/apache-solr-3-enterprise-search-server/book  I'd like to get Solr's website updated very soon.  Once it is updated, the publisher will send the Apache Software Foundation 5% of revenue.

I will attach a patch soon.  I must profess that I didn't run Apache Forest to verify the result, since I don't have access to JDK 1.5 and I have high confidence I got it right.  I would appreciate a committer doing a basic eyeball test of the results on the site, and clicking a few of the links.  One thing I hope happens is that the book image should appear at the top-left to replace the first edition. Strangely I don't see "Solr 3.1 Cookbook" right below it as I would expect, after looking at the xml I had to modify in my patch. I don't know why.
