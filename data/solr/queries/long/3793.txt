Günter Hipler reported on the solr-user mailing list that he was seeing inconsistencies in facet counts compared to the numFound when drilling down onto those facets (using "fq") - in particular: when adding an "fq" such as `fq=
{!term+f%3DnavNetwork}
nebis`, the resulting numFound was higher then the number of docs reported by the facet constraint for nebis in the base request.

I've been able to trivially reproduce this using the example data from Solr 4.0-BETA, trunk@r1381400, and branch_4x@r1381400 (details in comment to follow)

Important things to note from Günter's email thread with his assessment of the problem...

The behaviour is not consistent. Some of the facets provide the correct result, some not.  What I can't say for sure: The behaviour was correct (if I'm not wrong) once the whole index was newly created. After running some updates I got these results.

I'm going to setup a new index with the Lucene 4.0 version from March (to be more exactly: it's version 4.0-2012-03-09_11-29-20) to see what are the results even in case of frequent updates ... the version deployed in march doesn't contain the error I now come across in Beta4.0
