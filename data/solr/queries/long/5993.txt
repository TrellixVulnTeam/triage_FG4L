If the clusterState and ZK disagree about the shard leader for awhile, a warning is printed to the log here:


         String warnMsg = String.format(Locale.ENGLISH, "Still seeing conflicting information about the leader "
              + "of shard %s for collection %s after %d seconds; our state says %s, but ZooKeeper says %s",
              cloudDesc.getShardId(), collection, tries, clusterStateLeaderUrl, leaderUrl);



The issue is that the clusterStateLeaderUrl and leaderUrl are updated but not checked before the warning, so a warning can be printed to the log saying something like:
our state says localhost:9893_solr but ZooKeeper says localhost:9893_solr

which is confusing because there is no conflict.
