It would be useful to support commitWithin HTTP GET request param on all UpdateRequestHandlers.
That way, you could set commitWithin on the request (for XML, JSON, CSV, Binary and Extracting handlers) with this syntax:



  curl http://localhost:8983/solr/update/extract?literal.id=123&commitWithin=10000
       -H "Content-Type: application/pdf" --data-binary @file.pdf



PS: The JsonUpdateRequestHandler and BinaryUpdateRequestHandler already support this syntax.
