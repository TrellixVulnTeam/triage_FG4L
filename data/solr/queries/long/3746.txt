Per irc conversation with yonik, it's not clear if updateLog works correctly in all situations if there is no _version_ field in the schema...


	it's certainly not tested
	SOLR-3432 makes it clear there are at least some problematic sitautions



For these reasons, updateLog initialization should fail fast with a clear error if there is no _version_ field in the schema.

(we can always relax this restriction later if people write the code/tests for it)
