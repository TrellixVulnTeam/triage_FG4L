If your uniqueKey is not stored, you get this warning:

uniqueKey is not stored - distributed search will not work

There is at least one other feature that relies on a stored uniqueKey - MoreLikeThis.  Attaching a patch that updates the warning message.  It may actually require a more generic message.  It's possible there are other features that will not work without storing the uniqueKey.
