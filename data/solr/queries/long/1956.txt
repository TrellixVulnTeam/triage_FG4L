After merging Lucene/Solr, we need to compile lucene/solr manually to launch luke.

For branch_3x:



$ cd solr
$ ant luke
=> Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/lucene/search/Collector

$ ant compile
$ ant luke
=> Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/lucene/xmlparser/CoreParser

$ cd ../lucene/contrib/xml-query-parser
$ ant
$ cd ../../../solr
$ ant luke
=> luke can be launched



For trunk, it seems that luke-1.0.1 uses o.a.l.a.SimpleAnalyzer, but the class has been changed package name to o.a.l.a.core (and luke-1.0.1 doesn't support flex in the first place?):


$ ant luke
=> Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/lucene/analysis/SimpleAnalyzer



So I'd like to fix it for branch_3x for luke-1.0.1 at the beginning.
