Same as http://code.google.com/p/lucene-hunspell/issues/detail?id=3

Hunspell dictionaries are by nature case sensitive. The Hunspell stemmer thus needs an option to allow case insensitive matching of the dictionaries.

Imagine a query for "microsofts". It will never be stemmed to the dictionary word "Microsoft" because of the case difference. This problem cannot be fixed by putting LowercaseFilter before Hunspell.
