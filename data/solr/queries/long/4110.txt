The PHPResponseWriter and PHPSerializedResponseWriter currently send a hard coded Content-Type header of text/plain; charset=UTF-8 although there are constants defining text/x-php;charset=UTF-8 and text/x-php-serialized;charset=UTF-8 which remain unused. This makes content type guessing on the client side quite complicated.

I already created a patch (from the branch_4x github branch) to use the respective constants and also added the possibility to configure the Content-Type header via solrconfig.xml (like in JSONResponseWriter).
