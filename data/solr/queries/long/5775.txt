Currently, solr tests are failing 90%+ of the time. We've been through this before many times, the argument is always that someone is looking at the failures and knows which ones are bad.

This argument is a lie. Nobody is watching these failures, or DistributedQueryComponentOptimizationTest would not have failed repeatedly for two straight days when the fix was trivial (I fixed this last night: http://svn.apache.org/r1571930)

Its frustrating to me as a committer, solr tests NEVER pass on my machine, no matter how many times I try. How can i possibly commit something without knowing i am making the situation even worse?

This is all a big problem for developers, release managers, even users of the project. The test suite should pass.

The old argument that "solr tests are allowed to fail" is no longer valid. I will disable all constantly failing tests.
