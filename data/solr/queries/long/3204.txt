The solr-commons-csv artifact reused the code from the Apache Commons CSV project but the package wasn't changed to something else than org.apache.commons.csv in the process. This creates a compatibility issue as the Apache Commons team works toward an official release of Commons CSV. It prevents Commons CSV from using its own org.apache.commons.csv package, or forces the renaming of all the classes to avoid a classpath conflict.
