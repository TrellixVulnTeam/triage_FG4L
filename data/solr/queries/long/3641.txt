CoreContainer has some suspicious code that reads "roles" attribute from solr.xml, but doesn't ever seem to write it back.

not clear to me what exactly "roles" is for, or if any code paths in CoreAdminHandler or the new collections API can modify the "roles", but if so there's a bug in there somewhere.
