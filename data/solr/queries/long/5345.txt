Typically the symptom with jenkins is strange socket failures (because sockets are files too).

On my machine though i got the nice too many open files from lucene because it just happened to fail that way.

In addition to holding thousands of open files, this test creates 90 megabytes of logging output!

Can we tone down the test? I havent looked at all: but it doesn't seem necessary to have huge numbers of cores/indexes to test the functionality, we should be able to do this with relatively small numbers. 

Additionally i dont think its good to use random merge/IW buffering parameters here, we should set ones that won't make tons of files, force the use of compound file format, etc.

The massive amounts of logging should be addressed too.
