There is an issue with the ruby response (and others too, perhaps json and python) when an "integer" field is sent with leading zeros.   For example (from a report to ruby-dev@lucene), the Solr response is:

 {'responseHeader'=>{'status'=>0,'QTime'=>1,'params'=>{'wt'=>'ruby','rows'=>'1','start'=>'5','q'=>'accounting','fl'=>'zip_code','qt'=>'standard'}},'response'=>{'numFound'=>15005,'start'=>5,'docs'=>[
{'zip_code'=>[08817]}
]}}

Which gives this error:

 solr/response/ruby.rb:30:in `initialize': invalid ruby code:
 (eval):1:in `initialize': compile error (Solr::Exception) (eval):1:
 Illegal octal digit



I had proposed prefixing all integer ruby output with '0d' which would do the trick nicely.   Yonik, however, proposed simply stripping leading zeros for json and subclasses.
