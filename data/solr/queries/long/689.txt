Per mailing list discussion (see link below) it seems prudent to rename multicore.xml to solr.xml prior to the 1.3 release.

short summary of the main motivations for doing this...


   1) The name of the file corresponds with one specific way it can be
      used, but may not be applicable to all usages (namely: you can
      have a multicore.xml file but only use one core)
   2) The "first" config file checked to determine the application's
      behavior, and what paths will be checked for other config files
      is named after one specific feature of the application. 




General consensus of the thread so far seems to be that this is a good idea, and gives us more options for the future.
