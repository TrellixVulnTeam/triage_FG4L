This patch include a new feature called "Field collapsing".

"Used in order to collapse a group of results with similar value for a given field to a single entry in the result set. Site collapsing is a special case of this, where all results for a given web site is collapsed into one or two entries in the result set, typically with an associated "more documents from this site" link. See also Duplicate detection."
http://www.fastsearch.com/glossary.aspx?m=48&amid=299

The implementation add 3 new query parameters (SolrParams):
"collapse.field" to choose the field used to group results
"collapse.type" normal (default value) or adjacent
"collapse.max" to select how many continuous results are allowed before collapsing

TODO (in progress):

	More documentation (on source code)
	Test cases



Two patches:

	"field_collapsing.patch" for current development version
	"field_collapsing_1.1.0.patch" for Solr-1.1.0
