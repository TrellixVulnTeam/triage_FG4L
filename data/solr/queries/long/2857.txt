Something I've been thinking about lately... it'd be great to get rid of all the specific update handlers like /update/csv, /update/extract, and /update/json and collapse them all into a single /update that underneath uses the content-type(s) to hand off to specific content handlers.  This would make it much easier to toss content at Solr and provide a single entry point for updates.
