This was talked before at:
http://www.nabble.com/ClientUtils-escape-query-td18833559.html
I didn't notice it at that time though.

This method outputs weird string when Japanese letters are given for example. "J1J2J3J4J5" => "\J1\J2\J3\J4\J5" We don't want to see it.
It should use QueryParser.escape() code as it says in javadoc.
