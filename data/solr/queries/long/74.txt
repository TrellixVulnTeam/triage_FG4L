There are a number of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the Solr admin JSP pages, wherever data is being re-displayed as typed by the user.  

For example, in analysis.jsp:  <textarea class="std" rows="1" cols="70" name="qval"><%= qval %></textarea>

These need to be modified to HTML escape the values rather than directly outputting the exact values. 

The other affected JSP pages: action.jsp and get-file.jsp
