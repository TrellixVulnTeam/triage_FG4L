The default HttpClient hostname verifier is the BROWSER_COMPATIBLE_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER which verifies the hostname that is being connected to matches the hostname presented within the certificate. This is meant to protect clients that are making external requests out across the internet, but requests within the the SOLR cluster should be trusted and can be relaxed to simplify the SSL/certificate setup process.
