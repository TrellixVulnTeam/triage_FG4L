After setting up two independent solr nodes using the SolrCloud tutorial, atomic updates to a field of type "payloads" gives an error when updating the destination node.

The error is:

SEVERE: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "100}"

The input sent to the first node is in the expected default format for a payload field (eg "foo|100") and that update succeeds. I've found that the update always works for the first node, but never the second.

I've tested each server running independently and found that this update works as expected.
