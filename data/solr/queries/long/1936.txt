The Unicode Character 'LINE SEPARATOR' (U+2028) is not escaped in json response, resulting in a exception when evaluting this response on a client (in our case a firefox 3.0.19 , chrome 5.0.375.55 beta) webbrowser.

Evaluting a response with this  U+2028 char results in a 'unterminated string literal' error in firefox.
