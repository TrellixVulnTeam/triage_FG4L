The DIH example schemas should be modified to include trie numeric/date fields, and add comments about the non-trie numeric/date fields being deprecated and removed in 5.0.

The DIH example solrconfig.xml files are also showing their age - they should be copied from the main example solrconfig.xml and have the config they need added back.
