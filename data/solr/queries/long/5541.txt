The QueryElevationComponent currently uses an xml file to map query strings to elevateIds and excludeIds.

This ticket adds the ability to pass in elevateIds and excludeIds through two new http parameters "elevateIds" and "excludeIds".

This will allow more sophisticated business logic to be used in selecting which ids to elevate/exclude.

Proposed syntax:

http://localhost:8983/solr/elevate?q=*:*&elevatedIds=3,4&excludeIds=6,8

The elevateIds and excludeIds point to the unique document Id.
