Today, the SolrCloud tests are based on the LuceneTestCase class hierarchy, which has a couple of issues around support for downstream projects:


	It's difficult to test SolrCloud support in a downstream project that may have its own test framework.  For example, some projects have support for different storage backends (e.g. Solr/ElasticSearch/HBase) and want tests against each of the different backends.  This is difficult to do cleanly, because the Solr tests require derivation from LuceneTestCase, while the other don't
	The LuceneTestCase class hierarchy is really designed for internal solr tests (e.g. it randomizes a lot of parameters to get test coverage, but a downstream project probably doesn't care about that).  It's also quite complicated and dense, much more so than a downstream project would want.



Given these reasons, it would be nice to provide a simple "MiniSolrCloudCluster", similar to how HDFS provides a MiniHdfsCluster or HBase provides a MiniHBaseCluster.
