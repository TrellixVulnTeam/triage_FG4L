As part of the start script development work SOLR-3617, example restructuring SOLR-3619, and the overall curb appeal work SOLR-4430, I'd like to have an option on the SystemInfoHandler that gives a shorter, well formatted JSON synopsis of essential information. I know "essential" is vague  but right now using curl to http://host:port/solr/admin/info/system?wt=json gives too much information when I just want a synopsis of a Solr server. 

Maybe something like &overview=true?

Result would be:


{
  "address": "http://localhost:8983/solr",
  "mode": "solrcloud",
  "zookeeper": "localhost:2181/foo",
  "uptime": "2 days, 3 hours, 4 minutes, 5 seconds",
  "version": "5.0-SNAPSHOT",
  "status": "healthy",
  "memory": "4.2g of 6g"
}



Now of course, one may argue all this information can be easily parsed from the JSON but consider cross-platform command-line tools that don't have immediate access to a JSON parser, such as the bin/solr start script.
