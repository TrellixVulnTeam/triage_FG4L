It would be good when indexing if the SolrJ CloudServer was leader aware so that we could avoid doing an extra hop for the data.  It would also be good if one could easily set things up based on data locality principles.  This might mean that CloudServer is aware of where on the network it is and would pick leaders that are as close as possible (i.e. local, perhaps.)  This would come in to play when working with tools like Hadoop or other grid computing frameworks.
