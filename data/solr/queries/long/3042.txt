The maven jetty plugin is very popular and useful because it allows you to run a web application with a trivial command line execution "mvn jetty:run" and without setting up a servlet engine or deploying your app to it.  Perhaps more importantly, it allows fast debug cycles in development.  The plugin is misconfigured right now and I'm told its pedigree was a copy-paste from somewhere â€“ it was never verified to work.  Attached is a patch that configures it properly.  There's not much to it.
