Currently the ReRankingQParserPlugin requires the client to drop the re-rank parameter during paging if it only wants the top N documents to be re-ranked and is getting past that N. This also requires that the N must fall on page borders. 

ReRankingQParserPlugin should provide transparency for the client by returning results beyond N in their regular (non-reranked) order.

NOTE: This ticket also fixed a bug when the main query contained fuzzy, range and other queries that need to rewritten.
