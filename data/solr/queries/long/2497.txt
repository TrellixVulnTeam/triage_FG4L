This implements the changes to NumericField (LUCENE-3065) in Solr. TrieField & Co would use NumericField for indexing and reading stored fields. To enable this some missing changes in Solr's internals (Field -> Fieldable) need to be done. Also some backwards compatible stored fields parsing is needed to read pre-3.2 indexes without reindexing (as the format changed a little bit and Document.getFieldable returns NumericField instances now).
