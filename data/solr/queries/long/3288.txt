Prior to the 4.0 release, audit the tutorial & example dirs and verify...


	command line output looks reasonable
	analysis examples/discussion matches field types used
	links to admin UI are correct for new UI.
	example/README.txt makes sense
	example/solr/README.txt makes sense (refer to multicore's, collection1, solr.xml etc...)
	example/solr/collection1/README.txt should probably exist and have good info on what a typical instanceDir looks like.
