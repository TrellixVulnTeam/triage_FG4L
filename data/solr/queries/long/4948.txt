While writing tests for SOLR-4914, I discovered that it's really difficult to create a CoreContainer.  There are a bunch of constructors which initialise different things, one (but only one!) of which also loads all the cores.  Then you have the Initializer object, which basically does the same thing.  Sort of.  And then the TestHarness doesn't actually use CoreContainer, but an anonymous subclass of CoreContainer which has it's own initialisation logic.  It would be nice to clean this up!
