Improve exception messages in parsing schema.xml and catch common user mistakes.

For example:

	If type is incorrect or omitted, the resulting exception message does not show the field name
	Forgetting to add multiValued="true" on a copyField destination is a common mistake. If a field is a destination for multiple copyFields, then this goes unnoticed until addition of documents fails with exception.
