I have not been able to duplicate this test issue on my systems yet, but on jenkins, some tests that start and stop jetty instances during the test are having trouble cleaning up and can bleed into other tests. I'm working on isolating the reason for this - I seem to have been ip banned from jenkins at the moment, but when I can ssh in there, I will be able to speed up the try/feedback loop some. I've spent a lot of time trying to duplicate across 3 other systems, but I don't see the same issue anywhere but our jenkins server thus far.
