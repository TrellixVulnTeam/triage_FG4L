For a given query string, a human editor can say what documents should be important.  This is related to a lucene discussion:

Ideally, the position could be determined explicitly by the editor - otherwise increasing the boost is probably sufficient.

This patch uses the Search Component framework to inject custom document boosting into the standard SearchHandler.
