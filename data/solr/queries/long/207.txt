snapinstaller (and snappuller) do the following to find the latest snapshot:
name=`find $
{data_dir}
 -name snapshot.* -print|grep -v wip|sort -r|head -1`

This recurses into all of the snapshot directories, doing much more disk-io than is necessary.
I think it is the cause of bloated kernel memory usage we have seen on some of our Linux boxes, caused
by kernel dentry and inode caches.   Those caches compete with buffer cache (caching the actual data of the index)
and can thus decrease performance.
