Observation


	When the code pasted below is executed, a MissingFormatArgumentException is raised (Format specifier 's').
	If setAction(..) is not called, no exception is thrown.



Solution


	Fixing the format call in ConcurrentUpdateSolrServer:164 might resolve the issue.



Information


	The issue is present in trunk.
	I don't have the resources available to submit a proper patch at the moment, but might do so in the future. Meanwhile I'm posting this bug to let you know.





ConcurrentUpdateSolrServer server = new ConcurrentUpdateSolrServer("http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1", 2, 2);
UpdateRequest updateRequest = new UpdateRequest();
SolrInputDocument document = new SolrInputDocument();
updateRequest.add(document);
updateRequest.setAction(UpdateRequest.ACTION.COMMIT, false, false);
server.request(updateRequest);
server.commit();
