See the improvements in LUCENE-2302.

TermAttribute has been deprecated for flexible indexing, as terms can really be anything, as long as they can
be serialized to byte[]. 

For character-terms, a CharTermAttribute has been created, with a more friendly API. Additionally this attribute
implements the CharSequence and Appendable interfaces.

We should convert all Solr tokenstreams to use this new attribute.
