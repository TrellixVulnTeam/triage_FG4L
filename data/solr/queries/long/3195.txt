For grouping queries, the timeAllowed parameter is ignored.  I couldn't find this limitation documented anywhere, and we would like to use that feature in our production system.  I have created a patch that makes grouping queries respect the timeAllowed parameter.  The test cases all pass, and it and it seems to work well.  I added support for both distributed and non-distributed grouping.
