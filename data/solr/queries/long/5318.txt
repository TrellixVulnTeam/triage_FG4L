the create core admin command don't take into account the transient core property, when the core is registered (so, the core will be never closed by the transient core cache)

To reproduce :
set transientCacheSize=2 and start with no cores

Create 3 cores :
curl "http://ip:port/solr/admin/cores?action=CREATE&name=coreX&instanceDir=path_to_instanceDir_coreX&dataDir=path_to_dataDir_coreX&loadOnStartup=false&transient=true"

Look at the status :
http://ip:port/solr/admin/cores?action=STATUS

All cores are still loaded.
One core should not be loaded (closed by the transient cache)
