got confused while testing SOLR-3679 because when you create a new SolrCore using the Admin UI, the form goes away, and you are still looking at the "core admin details" page for whatever SolrCore you were on when you clicked the "Add Core" button â€“ it would be nice if the successful completion of hte "Add Core" form would redirect you to the sub-page for the core you just added.
