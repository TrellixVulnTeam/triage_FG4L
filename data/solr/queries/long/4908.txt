The SolrContentHandler produces glued words when extracting html

for html documents like:


<html><head></head><body>glued<br/>words</body></html>



This was solved in Tika TIKA-343 but the problem occurs when using the extraction handler because the SolrContentHandler discards ignoreableWhitespace.
The Tika XHTMLContentHandler issues ignoreableWhitspace events with a newline in the character stream when a <br> tag is encountered.

The SolrContentHandler should be modified to add the ignorable whitespace to the content.

Reproduction Steps:

	POST the html example file from the attachtments to http://localhost:8983/solr/update/extract?literal.id=html-test-1&commit=true (e.g. with curl or HTTP Requester Plugin in Firefox)
	Query for the document http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?q=id%3A%22html-test-1%22&fl=content&wt=xml&indent=true
	Look for the field content, which contains the word "Shouldnotbeglued"
