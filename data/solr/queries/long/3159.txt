Solr is currently tested (and bundled) with a patched jetty-6 version.  

Ideally we can release and test with a standard version.

Jetty-6 (at codehaus) is just maintenance now.  New development and improvements are now hosted at eclipse.  Assuming performance is equivalent, I think we should switch to Jetty 8.
