TestReplicationHandler has a weird logic around the 'snapDir' variable. It attempts to remove snapshot folders, even though they're not closed yet. My recent patch uncovered the bug but I don't know how to fix it cleanly â€“ the test itself seems to be very fragile (for example I don't understand the 'namedBackup' variable which is always set to true, yet there are conditionals around it).
