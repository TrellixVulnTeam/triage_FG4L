the TermHistogram class in the LukeRequestHandler seems to properly count the occurances of terms with a freq of "1", but then when converting to a NamedLIst begins iterating at bucket "2" so the counts for freq of "1" don't appear in the result.

this may have been a conscious choice to eliminate superfluously high values for terms with a freq of one ... or it may have been a mistake assuming freq values of 1 would fall in the "2" bucket.
