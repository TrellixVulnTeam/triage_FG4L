1) Allow clients to express concepts like...

	"give me facet counts per day for every day this month."
	"give me facet counts per hour for every hour of today."
	"give me facet counts per hour for every hour of a specific day."
	"give me facet counts per hour for every hour of a specific day and give me facet counts for the
       number of matches before that day, or after that day." 
2) Return all data in a way that makes it easy to use to build filter queries on those date ranges.
