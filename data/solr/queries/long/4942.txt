SOLR-4926 seems to have uncovered some sporadic cloud/replication bugs related to using compound files.

We should updated SolrTestCaseJ4 and the majority of our test configs to better randomize indecConfig settings starting with compound file...


	update all test configs (that can be) to use xml include a common <indexConfig> snippet file
	make the sinppet file contain {{<useCompoundFile>$
{useCompoundFile:false}
</useCompoundFile>}}
	update SolrTestCaseJ4 to toggle that sys property randomly
