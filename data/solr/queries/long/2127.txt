Tried using the defaultCoreName attribute on a 2 core setup. After performing a swap, my solr.xml no longer contains the defaultCoreName attribute, and the core which was dafult is now renamed to "", so after restart of the process can't access it by it's former name and can't perform other operations on it such as rename, reload or swap...
