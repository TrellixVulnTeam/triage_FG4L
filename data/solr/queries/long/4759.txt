Cleanup to Velocity templates shipped under solr/example/solr/collection1/conf/velocity


	Add README.txt file with complete file list
	Add comments to all files
	Add indenting where feasible, fixed indenting in other places.  I don't believe I've broken anything that required precise indenting.
	Make file naming consistent.  We had this_that, thisThat and this-that
  Changed all to this_that, though also considered this-that.
	Modularize some files
	Included a hit_plain.vm example, though not active by default.
	Rewrote city/lon/lat selector to work from a hash, though doesn't change the behavior.
	CSS changes, primarily to make top "tabs" actually look like Tabs (primitive CSS, but at least conveys the idea)



As far as I know this doesn't change any behavior of the system, nor does it fix any existing bugs.  Although I might do bug fixing in a later patch, I wanted to keep this as a pure "code readability" patch.
