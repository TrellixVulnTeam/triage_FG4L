LUCENE-2048 introduced a SchemaField.indexOptions method which returns an IndexOptions object based on the omitTermFreqAndPosition and omitPosition boolean properties â€“ but after some consideration it was decided that it was not a good idea to expose that expert level class at this level of the Solr internal APIs, and that SchemaField should instead only expose direct accessors for the specific properties.
