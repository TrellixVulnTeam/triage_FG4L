see parent issue for context


	if CoreAdminHandler STATUS returns "core init failures" the admin UI should indicate those failures in some way
	failures should be indicated not only for core names that don't currently exist, but also for core names that do (indicating that a reload attempt failed)
	
		failures related to existing cores should probably be visually incorporated into the existing status info panels for those cores
