The issue occurs when users copy Solr's example "solr home" directory somewhere else, not relative to Solr's installation and paths break.  Paths like these:



<lib dir="../../dist/" regex="apache-solr-cell-\d.*\.jar" />
<lib dir="../../contrib/extraction/lib" regex=".*\.jar" />



I've addressed this in my own projects by introducing a new system property construct like dir="$
{solr.install.dir}
/contrib/extraction/lib".  But this requires a change to solrconfig.xml for every <lib> element.  There's got to be a better way such that Solr can be installed in one place, and <lib> directives can readily access the Solr "installation" directory path.
