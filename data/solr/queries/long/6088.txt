This ticket introduces the ReRankingQParserPlugin which adds query Reranking/Rescoring for Solr. It leverages the new RankQuery framework to plug-in the new Lucene QueryRescorer.

See ticket LUCENE-5489 for details on the use case.

Sample syntax:


q=*:*&rq={!rerank reRankQuery=$rqq reRankDocs=200 reRankWeight=3}


In the example above the mainQuery is executed and 200 docs are collected and re-ranked based on the results of the reRankQuery.
