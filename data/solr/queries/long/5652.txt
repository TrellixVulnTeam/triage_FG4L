Several times now, Uwe's jenkins has encountered a "walk already seen ..." assertion failure from DistribCursorPagingTest that I've been unable to fathom, let alone reproduce (although sarowe was able to trigger a similar, non-reproducible seed, failure on his machine)

Using this as a tracking issue to try and make sense of it.

Summary of things noticed so far:

	So far only seen on http://jenkins.thetaphi.de & sarowe's mac
	So far seen on MacOSX and Linux
	So far seen on branch 4x and trunk
	So far seen on Java6, Java7, and Java8
	fails occured in first block of randomized testing:
	
		we've indexed a small number of randomized docs
		we're explicitly looping over every field and sorting in both directions
	
	
	fails were sorting on one of the "*_dv_last" or "*_dv_first" fields (docValues=true, either sortMissingLast=true OR sortMissingFirst=true)
	
		for desc sorts, sort on same field asc has worked fine just before this (fields are in arbitrary order, but "asc" always tried before "desc")
		sorting on some other random fields has sometimes been tried before this and worked
