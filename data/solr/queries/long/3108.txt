There's a small bug in ZkStateReader.getReplicaProps() when you have multiple replicas of the same shard/slice hosted in one CoreContainer. Not that you would often do this, but I was playing around with shards & replicas using just one Solr instance and noticed it. The attached patch should make it clear, the check on !coreNodeName.equals(filterNodeName) will always be false in such case.
