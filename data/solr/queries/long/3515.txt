The Analysis page of the UI seems to be toggling the state of the "schema-browser_autoload" cookie when you toggle the "verbose" checkbox for the analysis output.

this seems like a mistake.

Note that it also does not seem to be possible to specify the "verbose" option as a URL param when loading the page (if it is i can't figure it out) which makes linking to specific examples from the tutorial somewhat difficult.
