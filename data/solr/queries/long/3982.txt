Started with Shawn's Request about a small refresh link, one change leads to the next, which is the reason why i changed this issue towards a more common one

This Patch brings:

	A "Refresh Status" Button
	A "Abort Import" Button
	Improved Status-Handling
(was buggy if you have multiple Cores with Handlers for Dataimport defined and you switched the view while at least one was running)
	Additional Stats on Rows/Documents
(on-the-fly calculated "X Docs/second")
	less buggy duration-to-readable-time conversion
(until now resulted in NaN's showing up on your Screen)



Original Description:

The dataimport section under each core on the admin gui does not provide a way to get the current import status.  I actually would like to see it automatically pull the status as soon as you click on "Dataimport" ... I have never seen an import status with a qtime above 1 millisecond.  A refresh icon/link would be good to have as well.

Additional note: the resulting URL in the address bar is a little odd:
http://server:port/solr/#/corename/dataimport//dataimport

Although i gave a short explanation on the URL looking a bit odd:

The first "dataimport" is required for the UI to detect which section you're browsing .. the second "/dataimport" (including the slash, yes) is coming from your solrconfig
