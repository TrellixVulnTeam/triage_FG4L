Twice on Uwe's Jenkins, DistribCursorPagingTest has paged through a small number of indexed docs and retrieved one fewer doc than the number of indexed docs.  Both of these failures were on trunk on Windows:

http://jenkins.thetaphi.de/job/Lucene-Solr-trunk-Windows/3708/
http://jenkins.thetaphi.de/job/Lucene-Solr-trunk-Windows/3713/  

I've also seen this twice on trunk on my OS X laptop (out of 875 trials).

None of the seeds have reproduced for me.

All the failures were using either Lucene41 or Lucene42 codec
