/admin/index.jsp could issue a double submit on IE causing Jetty to error out.

Here are the steps to reproduce on IE8 (only applies to IE8 on occasional basis, really more of an IE8 bug...):
1. Open IE8
2. Browse to http://localhost:8983/solr/admin
3. Submit a query
4. Displayed on Jetty log due to double submit:
SEVERE: org.mortbay.jetty.EofException
        at org.mortbay.jetty.HttpGenerator.flush(HttpGenerator.java:791)

This can be fixed easily by modifying index.jsp's javascript submit to return false:
... queryForm.submit(); return false; ...

I will try to submit a patch for this easy fix, new to all this so please bear with me...
