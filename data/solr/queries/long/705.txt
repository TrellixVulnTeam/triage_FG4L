SOLR-303 queries with &shards parameters set need to return the dociD->shard mapping in the response. Without it, updating/deleting documents when the # of shards is variable is hard. We currently set this with a special requestHandler that filters /update and inserts the shard as a field in the index but it would be better if the shard location came back in the query response outside of the index.
