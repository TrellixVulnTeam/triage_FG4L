The goal is to give Solr server clusters self-healing attributes
where if a server fails, indexing and searching don't stop and
all of the partitions remain searchable. For configuration, the
ability to centrally deploy a new configuration without servers
going offline.

We can start with basic failover and start from there?

Features:


	Automatic failover (i.e. when a server fails, clients stop
trying to index to or search it)




	Centralized configuration management (i.e. new solrconfig.xml
or schema.xml propagates to a live Solr cluster)




	Optionally allow shards of a partition to be moved to another
server (i.e. if a server gets hot, move the hot segments out to
cooler servers). Ideally we'd have a way to detect hot segments
and move them seamlessly. With NRT this becomes somewhat more
difficult but not impossible?
