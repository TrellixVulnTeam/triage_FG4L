As is, reading rules from the ResourceLoader is baked into inform(ResourceLoader loader).  It would be nice to be able to load custom rules w/o needing to rewrite the whole thing.  This issue changes two things:

	Changes List<String> to Iterable<String> because we don't really need a list
	adds protected Iterable<String> loadRules( String synonyms, ResourceLoader loader ) â€“ so subclasses could fill their own
