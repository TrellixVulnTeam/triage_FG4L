It would be useful to exclude the effects of some "fq" params from the set of documents used to compute stats â€“ similar to 
how you can exclude tagged filters when generating facet counts... 

https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SimpleFacetParameters#Tagging_and_excluding_Filters

So that it's possible to do something like this... 

http://localhost:8983/solr/select?fq=
{!tag=priceFilter}
price:[1 TO 20]q=:&stats=true&stats.field=
{!ex=priceFilter}
price 

If you want to create a price slider this is very useful because then you can filter the price ([1 TO 20) and nevertheless get the lower and upper bound of the unfiltered price (min=0, max=100):


|<-[-------]-------------->|
$0 $1     $20            $100
