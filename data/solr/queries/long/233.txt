If conf/xslt/example.xsl is applied to non-ASCII characters such as Arabic, the output gets garbled, because the output encoding is not properly specified.
The xsl:output element in example.xsl needs to be modified as suggested in the following email:

In example.xsl change the output type

   <xsl:output media-type="text/html"/>

to

   <xsl:output media-type="text/html; charset=UTF-8" encoding="UTF-8"/>


And see if that helps. I had the same problem (different language.)  
If this works we should file a JIRA to fix it up in trunk.
