Summary:
==========

	Admin UI replication/index.jsp checks for master or slave with the following code:
   if ("true".equals(detailsMap.get("isSlave"))) 
	if slave, replication/index.jsp displays the "Master" and "Poll Intervals", etc. sections (everything up to "Cores")
	if false, replication/index.jsp does not display the "Master", "Poll Intervals" sections
-This "slave check/UI difference" works correctly if the solrconfig.xml has a  "slave" but not "master" section or vice versa



Expected results:
==================
Same UI difference would occur in the following scenario:
   a) solrconfig.xml has both master and slave entries
   b) use java.properties (-Dsolr.enable.master -Dsolr.enable.slave) to set "master" or "slave" at runtime

OR
    c) use solrcore.properties  to set "master" and "slave" at runtime

Actual results:
==================
If solrconfig.xml has both master and slave entries, replication/index.jsp shows both "master" and "slave" section regardless of system.properties or solrcore.properties
