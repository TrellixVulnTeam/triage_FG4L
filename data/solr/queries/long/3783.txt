We get an http 500 as follow :




<lst name="error">
  <str name="trace">java.lang.NullPointerException</str>
  <int name="code">500</int>
</lst>




When facet.missing is turned on and combined with facet.pivot (if one of the pivot-faceted fields have missing counts -)

Ideally, the decission tree could be computing for the missing "entries" using the 

 -field:[* TO *] 

 query but it might be a performance issue on a large index (I guess)

The fallback to this could be to raise a 400 error with a clean message telling that both parameters can't be combined and then the documentation should be modified accordingly.
