This patch

	converts all analysis tests to use the new tokenstream api
	converts most tests to use the more stringent assertion mechanisms from lucene
	adds new tests to improve coverage



Most bugs found by more stringent testing have been fixed, with the exception of SynonymFilter.
The problems with this filter are more serious, the previous tests were essentially a no-op.
The new tests for SynonymFilter test the current behavior, but have FIXMEs with what I think the old test wanted to expect in the comments.
