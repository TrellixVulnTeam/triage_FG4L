The HttpClient library used by CommonsHttpSolrServer will retry by default 3 times a request that failed on the server side, even if the _maxRetries field of  CommonsHttpSolrServer is set to 0.
The retry count should be managed in just one place and CommonsHttpSolrServer seems to be the right one. 
CommonsHttpSolrServer should override that HttpClient default to 0 retries, and manage the retry count with the value of the field _maxRetries.
