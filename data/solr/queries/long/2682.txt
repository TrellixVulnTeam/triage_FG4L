addException() which is super historic, pre-apache code, should be removed from SimpleFacet. Hoss described in the mail thread http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-solr-user/201107.mbox/%3Calpine.DEB.2.00.1107281651200.12738@bester%3E


: If I got an exception during faceting (e.g. undefined field), Solr doesn't
: return HTTP 400 but 200 with the exception stack trace in <arr name="exception">
: ...</arr> tag. Why is it implemented so? I checked Solr 1.1 and saw the same behavior.

super historic, pre-apache, code ... the idea at the time was that some 
parts of the response (like faceting, highlightin, watever...) would be 
"optional" and if there was an error computing that data it wouldn't fail 
the main request.

that logic should really be ripped out.
