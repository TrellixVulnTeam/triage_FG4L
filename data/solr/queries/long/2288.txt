there's a ton of compiler warning in the solr tree, and it's high time we cleaned them up, or annotate them to be suppressed so we can start making a bigger stink when/if code is added to the tree thta produces warnings (we'll never do a good job of noticing new warnings when we have ~175 existing ones)

Using this issue to track related commits

The goal of this issue should not be to change any functionality or APIs, just deal with each warning in the most appropriate way;


	fix generic declarations
	add SuppressWarning anotation if it's safe in context
