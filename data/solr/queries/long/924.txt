There are some occurences of finalizers in the code base. While the presence of them is debatable and discussed in a separate JIRA - the ones that are retained are better off wrapped around a try .. finally block to recursively call the finalizer of the super class for proper resource usage unwinding , (in case finalizers get invoked ).
