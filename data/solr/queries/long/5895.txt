An IOException raised during analysis is swallowed by JavabinLoader, so the underlying cause is not visible in the logs, or to the client.  Proposed fix is to change



throw new SolrException(SolrException.ErrorCode.SERVER_ERROR, "ERROR adding document " + document);



to



throw new SolrException(SolrException.ErrorCode.SERVER_ERROR, "ERROR adding document " + document, e);
