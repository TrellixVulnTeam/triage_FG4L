While the http spec states requests without a content-type should be treated as application/octet-stream, the html spec says instead that post requests without a content-type should be treated as a form (http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_8.html#SEC8.2.1).  It would be nice to allow large search requests from html forms, and not have to rely on the browser to set the content type (since the spec says it doesn't have to).
