While fiddeling with SOLR-4345, i realized that the Query-Interface does not really work in IE (at least IE10, i guess that's also valid for IE9 and maybe others)

The Interface itself (including the Form on the left side, including various options) is there, but if you submit the Form, the result is always empty (as in 0 Documents returned) because of the used url:
