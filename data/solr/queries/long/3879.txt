This is incorrect and can lead to deployment issues:


Servlet Spec 2.5

SRV.9.7.2 Web Application Class Loader
The class loader that a container uses to load a servlet in a WAR must
allow the developer to load any resources contained in library JARs
within the WAR following normal J2SE semantics using getResource. As
described in the J2EE license agreement, servlet containers that are
not part of a J2EE product should not allow the application to
override J2SE platform classes, such as those in the java.* and
javax.* namespaces, that J2SE does not allow to be modified. Also,
servlet containers that are part of a J2EE product should not allow
the application to override J2SE or J2EE platform classes, such as
those in java.* and javax.* namespaces, that either J2SE or J2EE do
not allow to be modified. The container should not allow applications
to override or access the containerâ€™s implementation



The fix is pretty easy and it would be nice to include it in the upcoming release of Solr 4.0
