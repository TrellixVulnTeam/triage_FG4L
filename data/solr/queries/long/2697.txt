commit and autocommit operations don't reset DirectUpdateHandler2.numDocsPending stats attribute (see attached screenshots)

I believe this regression was caused by DUH2 refactorings (near realtime, etc). See commit https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/commit/ffd9c717448eca895d19be8ee9718bc399ac34a7#diff-18
