I just upgraded to Solr 4.2 and cannot explain the following behaviour:

I am using a solr.TrieDoubleField named 'ListPrice_EUR_INV' as a facet-field. The solr-response for the query 

'solr/Products/select?q=*%3A*&wt=xml&indent=true&facet=true&facet.field=ListPrice_EUR_INV&f.ListPrice_EUR_INV.facet.sort=index'

includes the following facet-counts:

<lst name="ListPrice_EUR_INV">
  <int name="-420.126">1</int>
  <int name="-285.672">1</int>
  <int name="-1.218">1</int>
</lst>


If I also set the parameter 'facet.mincount=1' in the query, the order of the facet-counts is reversed.

<lst name="ListPrice_EUR_INV">
  <int name="-1.218">1</int>
  <int name="-285.672">1</int>
  <int name="-420.126">1</int>
</lst>


I would have expected, that the sort-order of the facet-counts is not affected by the facet.mincount parameter, as it is in Solr 4.1.
Is this related to SOLR-2850?
