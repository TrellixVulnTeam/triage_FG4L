I haven't tested this yet, so I could be wrong, but this is my reading of the code:
During init:


ElectionContext context = new OverseerElectionContext(zkClient, overseer, getNodeName());
overseerElector.setup(context);
overseerElector.joinElection(context, false);



On reconnect:


ElectionContext context = new OverseerElectionContext(zkClient,overseer, getNodeName());
              
ElectionContext prevContext = overseerElector.getContext();
if (prevContext != null) {
  prevContext.cancelElection();
}
              
overseerElector.joinElection(context, true);



setup doesn't appear to be called on reconnect, so the new context is never set and the first context gets cancelled over and over.

A call to overseerElector.setup(context); before joinElection in the reconnect case would address this.
