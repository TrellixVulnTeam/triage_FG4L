This tracks the creation of a patch that adds the n-gram/edge n-gram tokenizing functionality that was initially part of SOLR-81 (spell checking). This was taken out b/c the lucene SpellChecker class removed this dependency. None-the-less, I think this is useful functionality and the addition is trivial. How does everyone feel about such an addition?
