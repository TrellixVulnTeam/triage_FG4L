The name attribute on SolrIndexSearcher is used in log lines, but does not include the core name.

So in a multi-core setup it is unnecessarily difficult to trace what core's searcher is being referred to, e.g. in log lines that provide info on searcher opens & closes.

One-line patch that helps:

Replace


this.name = "Searcher@" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode()) + (name!=null ? " "+name : "");



with


this.name = "Searcher@" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode()) + "[" + core.getName() + "]" + (name!=null ? " "+name : "");
