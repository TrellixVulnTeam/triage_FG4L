Chris Collins reported on solr-user that solr-core 4.4 has dependencies on hadoop, and indirectly on jetty 6.

As a workaround for Maven dependencies, the indirect jetty 6 dependency/ies can be excluded.

The Maven configuration should exclude any compile-time (and also run-time) dependencies that are not Ant/Ivy compile- and run-time dependencies, including jetty 6.
