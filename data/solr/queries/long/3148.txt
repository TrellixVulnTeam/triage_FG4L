The following info is not returned even when they are available (on java 1.6 and 1.7): 



getSystemLoadAverage()
getOpenFileDescriptorCount()
getMaxFileDescriptorCount()
getCommittedVirtualMemorySize()
getTotalPhysicalMemorySize()
getTotalSwapSpaceSize()
getProcessCpuTime()



This is happening because the following exception is thrown: 



java.lang.IllegalAccessException: Class org.apache.solr.handler.admin.SystemInfoHandler can not access a member of class com.sun.management.UnixOperatingSystem with modifiers "public native"



It seems to be enough to call setAccessible(true) on the method to get rid of that exception.

Additionally I see a strange value for the ulimit key:

"ulimit":"(error executing: ulimit -n)",
