The fix to SOLR-1008 was wrong.  It used chardata escaping for a value that is an attribute value.

I.e. instead of XML.escapeCharData it should call XML.escapeAttributeValue.

Otherwise, any query used as a key in the filter cache whose printed representation contains a double-quote character causes invalid XML to be generated.
