I've always found that starting Solr with java -jar start.jar is a little odd if you are not a java guy, but I think there are bigger pros than looking less odd in shipping some start scripts.

Not only do you get a cleaner start command:
sh solr.sh or solr.bat or something
But you also can do a couple other little nice things:

	it becomes fairly obvious for a new casual user to see how to start the system without reading doc.
	you can make the working dir the location of the script - this lets you call the start script from another dir and still have all the relative dir setup work.
	have an out of the box place to save startup params like -Xmx.
	we could have multiple start scripts - say solr-dev.sh that logged to the console and default to sys default for RAM - and also solr-prod which was fully configured for logging, pegged Xms and Xmx at some larger value (1GB?) etc.



You would still of course be able to make the java cmd directly - and that is probably what you would do when it's time to run as a service - but these could be good starter scripts to get people on the right track and improve the initial user experience.
