Sine 1.0, the Solr Admin screen has had a "Distribution" link which points to "distributiondump.jsp" and displays stats according to data files created by the snappuller/snapinstaller scripts

With the new java based replication, when a ReplicationHandler is enabled, we now have a "Replication" link on the admin page pointing to "replication/index.jsp" which displays stats/status for java based replication.

In at least one instance, these two different links confused a user...

We need to rectify this confusion prior to releasing 1.4.
