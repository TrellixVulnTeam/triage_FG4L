This makes it so that if a leader goes down before any replicas sync from it, one of the replicas won't take over. But because we wait a while for known replicas to come up and sync + pick the best leader, we should not need to be so strict in this protection and let a replica take a stab at being the leader - it may have been up to date and was only publishing through recovery phases to find that out.
