If you use the core admin handler to create core and reference system properties and index files without restarting Solr, your files are indexed to the wrong place.

Say for instance I define a sys prop EOE=/Users/Erick/tmp and create a core with this request
localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=CREATE&name=coreZ&instanceDir=coreZ&dataDir=%24%7BEOE%7D

where %24%7BEOE%7D is really $
{EOE} after URL escaping. What gets preserved in solr.xml is correct, dataDir is set to ${EOE}
. And if I restart Solr, then index documents, they wind up in /Users/Erick/tmp. This is as it should be.

HOWEVER, if rather than immediately restart Solr I index some documents to CoreZ, they go in <solr_home>/CoreZ/$
{EOE}. The literal path is ${EOE}
, dollar sign, curly braces and all.

How important is this to fix for 4.4?
