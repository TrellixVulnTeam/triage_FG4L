The sequence of events which might trigger this is as follows:


	Leader of a shard, say OL, has a ZK expiry
	The new leader, NL, starts the election process
	NL, through Overseer, clears the current leader (OL) for the shard from the cluster state
	OL reconnects to ZK, calls onReconnect from event thread (main-EventThread)
	OL marks itself down
	OL sets up watches for cluster state, and then retrieves it (with no leader for this shard)
	NL, through Overseer, updates cluster state to mark itself leader for the shard
	OL tries to register itself as a replica, and waits till the cluster state is updated
   with the new leader from event thread
	ZK sends a watch update to OL, but it is blocked on the event thread waiting for it.



Oops. This finally breaks out after trying to register itself as replica times out after 20 mins.
