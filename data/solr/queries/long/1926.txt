If hl.q parameter is set, HighlightComponent uses it rather than q.

Use case:

You search "PC" with highlight and facet capability:



q=PC
&facet=on&facet.field=maker&facet.field=something
&hl=on&hl.fl=desc



You get a lot of results with snippets (term "PC" highlighted in desc field). Then you click a link "maker:DELL(50)" to narrow the result:



q=PC
&facet=on&facet.field=something
&fq=maker:DELL
&hl=on&hl.fl=desc



You'll get narrowed result with term "PC" highlighted snippets. But, sometimes I'd like to see "DELL" to be highlighted as well, because I clicked "DELL". In this case, hl.q can be used:



q=PC
&facet=on&facet.field=something
&fq=maker:DELL
&hl=on&hl.fl=desc&*hl.q=PC+maker:DELL*



Note that hl.requireFieldMatch should be false (false is default) in this scenario.
