A large quantity of code is duplicated between the deprecated HighlightingUtils class and the newer SolrHighlighter and DefaultSolrHighlighter (which have been getting bug fixes and enhancements). The Utils class is no longer used anywhere in Solr, but people writing plugins may be taking advantage of it, so it should be cleaned up.
