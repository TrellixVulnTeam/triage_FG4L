DebugComponent currently uses Explanation.toString() to "format" score explanations for each document as plain text with whitespace indenting to denote the hierarchical relationship, and then adds those explanations to the SolrQueryResponse.

Instead DebugComponent should transform the Explanation objects into NamedLists so that the full structure can be formatted in a logical way by the ResponseWriter
