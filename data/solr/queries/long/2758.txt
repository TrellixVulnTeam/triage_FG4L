There is exactly one small dependency that the SolrJ jar has to lucene-core and that is indirectly via ConcurrentLRUCache which is in common/util.  SolrJ doesn't even use this cache but it's there any way.  Attached is a patch for the move. It also removes the lucene-core dependency that the SolrJ maven pom.xml has on lucene-core.
