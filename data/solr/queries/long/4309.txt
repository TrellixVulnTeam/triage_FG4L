Three problems with current autosuggest JavaScript behavior in Velocity /browse:

1. The first entry in the list is pre-selected, so hitting ENTER searches the first suggestion instead of what the user entered
2. jQuery autosuggest's built-in cache is buggy, rendering funny suggestion lists 2nd time
3. Using the arrow buttons and hitting ENTER only fills in the selected item into the search box, does not perform the search
