After the patch for SOLR-4972 was introduced, the usage for zkcli.sh -cmd makepath changed to

zkcli.sh -zkhost localhost:9983 -cmd makepath /apache/solr/data.txt 'config data'

Yet that is not what the command expects, it expects just a single path to create, no data can be supplied.

"put" is the new way to create an actual file in ZK.

Am assuming makepath should have stayed as it was (so command is correct, but usage is wrong), alternatively usage might be right and makepath could be a superset of PUT (but that seems unlikely)
