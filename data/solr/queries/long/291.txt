WHAT:
A flag "noCacheIfLarger" is added to <queryResultWindowSize/> tag, i.e. <queryResultWindowSize noCacheIfLarger="true">50</queryResultWindowSize>. The flag can be omitted and the default is false.

If this flag is set to true and user requires more results (in this case, start>=50), SolrIndexSearcher doesn't put the docList into queryResultCache.

WHY(USE CASE):
The Solr administrator can calculate max memory consumption for filterCache and documentCache as follows:

filterCache: BitDocSet size * max size (cache entries)
documentCache: average document size * max size (cache entries)

however, the memory consumtion for queryResultCache is unpredictable.

With this patch, if the administrator wants to control memory consumtion more strict, he can set queryResultWindowSize with noCacheIfLarger="true".
