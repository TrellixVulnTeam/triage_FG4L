Some possible solutions:

	wait and see if we get resolution on http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-1340. To be honest, I am not even sure where jetty is being maintained (there is a separate jetty project at eclipse.org with another bugtracker, but the older releases are at codehaus).
	include a patched version of jetty with correct utf-8, using that patch.
	remove jetty and include a different container instead.
