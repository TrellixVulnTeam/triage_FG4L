FieldType#indexedToReadable(BytesRef, CharArr) uses a noggit dependency that also spreads into ByteUtils. The uses of this method area all convert to String which makes this extra reference and the dependency unnecessary. I refactored it to simply return string and removed ByteUtils entirely. The only leftover from BytesUtils is a constant, i moved that one to Lucenes UnicodeUtils. I will upload a patch in a second
