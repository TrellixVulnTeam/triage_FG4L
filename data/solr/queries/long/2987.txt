The current error handling in reading an external file field only catches an error when parsing the float value on a line, which then skips that line.  If the key field is a trie field, such as a TrieIntField, and the key value in the file cannot be parsed to an int, loading of the entire file fails.  

Shouldn't the call to get the indexed value of the key should be in the same try/catch as the float parsing for the line?
