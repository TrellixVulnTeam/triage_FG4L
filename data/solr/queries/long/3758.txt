It seems like spellchecker using solr.DirectSolrSpellChecker doesn't work when grouping results.

/select?q=mispeled
Gives me correct spellingsuggestions

but..
/select?q=mispeled&group=true&group.main=true&group.field=title
don't give any suggestions.

It worked in 3.5 with indexbased spellchecker.

It seems like if i mispell something that returns 0 results i dont get any suggestions. If i misspell something that genereate a result i get suggestions on it.
It should come up with proper suggestions even if there are no results to be displayed (But there is things that should be suggested).
Long story short. Same functionality as in 3.5
