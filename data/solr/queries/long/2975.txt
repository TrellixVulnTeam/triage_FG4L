ant test -Dtestcase=TestSolrEntityProcessorUnit fails when running under Java 1.5 because of faulty assumptions in the test.

From e-mail thread (Hossman):
...those lines are assuming that row.entrySet will return something that
has a predictible iteration order, but row is a Map of unknown creation
(returned by the entityProcessor) ... so unless the entityProcessor is
explicitly defined as returning something like SortedMap (which isn't
suggested anywhere in this test) the test is making a really bad
assumption.

From e-mail. (Steven Rowe)
FYI, I see this same failure when I run the branch_3x tests with Java 1.5, but not 1.6.
and
Oh, and the reason Jenkins isn't seeing this failure is that it runs branch_3x tests using Java 1.6, after first compiling with Java 1.5

Even though we won't run Solr 4 under java 1.5, I'll change it there anyway since this is a bad assumption in the test.
