A broader discussion is taking place on the dev list about how we want to more forward with dealing with core/solr documentation in a post-forrest world, but a more immediate concern is while the forrest based docs on the lucene side of things are already version specific and could be released now, the solr forrest docs are not â€“ if we attempted to release 3.6 today the solr "docs" dir would contain a complete copy of the old forrest generated website that would make no sense to users.

we could just flat out remove the solr forrest docs, but that doesn't really address the issue of the tutorial.  A copy of the tutorial currently exists on the CMS powered website, but since it's not versioned it won't really help with the 3.6 vs 4x situation that will arise in the very near future.

My suggestion for the short term is that we do the following on both branches:

	svn mv solr/site/tutorial.html solr/core/src/java/doc-files and then clean it up to remove all the forrest navigation
	update solr/core/src/java/overview.html to mention and link to the tutorial
	eliminate solr/site and solr/site-src from trunk and branch-3x and adjust the build.xml as needed



...that would get us into the state where we could release 3.6 at will w/o a weird documentation cluster fuck, and the contents of https://lucene.apache.org/solr/tutorial.html could be updated to become a meta-info page about the tutorial with a link to http://lucene.apache.org/solr/api/tutorial.html (where we'd have already updated the javadocs to represent 3.6).
