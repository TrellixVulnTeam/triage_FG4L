From brian:

1) Download trunk/nightly
2) Change line 347 of example/solr/conf/solrconfig.xml to   <requestHandler name="/update" class="solr.XmlUpdateRequestHandler">
3) java -jar start.jar...
3) Run post.sh a bunch of times on the same xml file... (in a shell script or whatever)
4) After a few seconds/minutes jetty will crash with "too many open files"

all you've got to do is

apache-solr-nightly/example/exampledocs ryan$ while [ 0 -lt 1 ]; do ./post.sh hd.xml; done

with the request handler pointing to /update. Use


	lsof | grep solr | wc -l



to watch the fdescs fly.
