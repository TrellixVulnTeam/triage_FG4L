If I start replication by issuing a "fetchindex" command with a "masterUrl" parameter, it seems to me (by looking at the trunk code) that "abortfetch" command would not do anything. 
It appears to be aborting only when replication is configured with hardcoded master/slave cores.

The fix appears to be to use tempSnapPuller.abortPull always because tempSnapPuller is always the snap puller doing the actual work.
