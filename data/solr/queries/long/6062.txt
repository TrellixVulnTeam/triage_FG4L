SOLR-2058 subtly changed how phrase queries, created through the pf, pf2 and pf3 parameters, are merged into the main user query.

For the query: 'term1 term2' with pf2:[field1, field2, field3] we now get (omitting the non phrase query section for clarity):



<main query>
DisjunctionMaxQuery((field1:"term1 term2"^1.0)~0.1)
DisjunctionMaxQuery((field2:"term1 term2"^1.0)~0.1)
DisjunctionMaxQuery((field3:"term1 term2"^1.0)~0.1)



Prior to this change, we had:



<main query> 
DisjunctionMaxQuery((field1:"term1 term2"^1.0 | field2:"term1 term2"^1.0 | field3:"term1 term2"^1.0)~0.1)



The upshot being that if the phrase query "term1 term2" appears in multiple fields, it will get a significant boost over the previous implementation.
