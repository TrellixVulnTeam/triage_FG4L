Spinoff from: http://lucene.markmail.org/thread/ww6mhfi3rfpngmc5

The text fieldType in schema.xml is unusable for non-whitespace
languages, because it has the dangerous auto-phrase feature (of
Lucene's QP â€“ see LUCENE-2458) enabled.

Lucene leaves this off by default, as does ElasticSearch
(http://http://www.elasticsearch.org/).

Furthermore, the "text" fieldType uses WhitespaceTokenizer when
StandardTokenizer is a better cross-language default.

Until we have language specific field types, I think we should fix
the "text" fieldType to work well for all languages, by:


	Switching from WhitespaceTokenizer to StandardTokenizer




	Turning off auto-phrase
