After upgrading to solr 3.3.0 from 1.4.0, I noticed that I couldn't get the MoreLikeThisHandler to return debugging data. I tried the debug parameters  debugQuery and debug, but all I got was:
 <bool name="debug">true</bool>

I took a look at the code for the MoreLikeThisHandler, and noted in the debbuging part that the handler is adding the variable dbg to the response (line 211):
 rsp.add("debug", dbg);

Such variable is created at line 197:
boolean dbg = req.getParams().getBool(CommonParams.DEBUG_QUERY, false);

I suppose the correct variable to add to the response would be dbgInfo:
NamedList<Object> dbgInfo = SolrPluginUtils.doStandardDebug(req, q, mlt.getRawMLTQuery(), mltDocs.docList);
        if (null != dbgInfo) {
          if (null != filters) {
            dbgInfo.add("filter_queries",req.getParams().getParams(CommonParams.FQ));
            List<String> fqs = new ArrayList<String>(filters.size());
            for (Query fq : filters) 
Unknown macro: {
              fqs.add(QueryParsing.toString(fq, req.getSchema()));
            } 
            dbgInfo.add("parsed_filter_queries",fqs);
          }

Summarizing, i believe line 211 should be changed to:

rsp.add("debug", dbgInfo);
