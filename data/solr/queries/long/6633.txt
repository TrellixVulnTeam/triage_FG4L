it is a common requirement to store the entire JSON as a field in Solr. 

we can have a extra param srcField=field_name to specify the field name

the /update/json/docs is only useful when all the json fields are predefined or in schemaless mode.

The better option would be to store the content in a store only field and index the data in another field in other modes

the relevant section in solrconfig.xml


 <initParams path="/update/json/docs">
    <lst name="defaults">
      <!--this ensures that the entire json doc will be stored verbatim into one field-->
      <str name="srcField">_src</str>
      <!--This means a the uniqueKeyField will be extracted from the fields and
       all fields go into the 'df' field. In this config df is already configured to be 'text'
        -->
      <str name="mapUniqueKeyOnly">true</str>
       <str name="df">text</str>
    </lst>

  </initParams>
