I copy/paste the description I gave on the solr-user list.

starting
form the following query -

http://127.0.0.1:8080/solr-urbamet/select?q=(tout:1)&rows=0&sort=TITRE+desc&facet=true&facet.query=SUJET:b*&facet.field=SUJET&facet.prefix=b&facet.limit=1&facet.missing=true&wt=json&json.nl=arrarr&indent=on


	which produced a NullPointerException (see the stacktrace below), I
played with the parameters and obtained the following results :



##PAGINATION
rows : starting from 0, the exception occurs until we pass a certain threshold
=> rows implicated

##SORTING
the rows threshold afore mentionned seems to be influenced by the
presence/absence of the sort parameter

##FACETS
facet=false => OK while facet=true => NullPointerException
=>facets implicated
–
facet.field absent => OK while facet.field=whatever => NullPointerException
=>facet.field implicated
–
facet.missing=false => OK while facet.missing=true => NullPointerException
=> facet.missing implicated
–
facet.limit=-1 or 0 => OK while facet.limit>0  => NullPointerException
=> facet.limit implicated
–
facet.query absent or facet.query = whatever => NullPointerException
=>facet.query not implicated
–
facet.offset=(several values or absent) => NullPointerException
=> facet.offset not implicated
–
=> facet.sort not implicated (true or false => NullPointerException)
–
=> facet.mincount not implicated (several values or absent =>
NullPointerException)

#ResponseWriter
wt=standard => ok while wt=json => NullPointerException
=> jsonwriter implicated
json.nl=flat or map => ok
=> jsonwriter 'arrarr' format implicated
