the new spellcheck.collate feature seems to exhibit some strange behaviors when handed a query with multiple tokens.


{
 "responseHeader":{
  "params":{
	"q":"redbull air show"}},
  "spellcheck":{
   "suggestions":[
	"redbull",[
	 "suggestion",["redbelly"]],
	"show",[
	 "suggestion",["shot"]],
	"collation","redbelly airshotw"]}}



in this case, note the fields are incorrectly concatenated (no space between tokens, left over 'w' from input string)


{
 "responseHeader":{
  "params":{
	"q":"redbull air show",
	"spellcheck.q":"redbull air show"}},
 "spellcheck":{
  "suggestions":[
	"redbull air show",[
	 "suggestion",["redbull singers"]],
	"collation","redbull singersredbull air show"]}}



this is slightly different - the suggestions are still concatenated without a space, but the collation is way off.
