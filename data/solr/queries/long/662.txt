At present solr-ruby doesn't support the following hl functions:


	per-field override
	
		hl.snippets
		hl.fragsize
		hl.requireFieldMatch
		hl.simple.pre
		hl.simple.post
	
	




	non-per-field-override
	
		hl.alternateField
		hl.maxAlternateFieldLength
	
	




	other hl parameters
	
		hl.maxAnalyzedChars (w/ per-field override)
		hl.usePhraseHighlighter
		hl.mergeContiguous (w/ per-field override)
		hl.increment (w/ per-field override)
		hl.formatter (w/ per-field override)
		hl.fragmenter (w/ per-field override)
		hl.regex.slop (w/ per-field override)
		hl.regex.pattern (w/ per-field override)
		hl.regex.maxAnalyzedChars (w/ per-field override)
	
	



A patch supports these functions will be shortly.
