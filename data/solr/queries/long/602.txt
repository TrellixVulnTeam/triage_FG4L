SolrQuery has umpteen no:of setter methods and one needs to invoke a
lot of them before sending the query. Can we make the 'setter' methods
return 'this' so that users can chain the method calls and make the
client code simpler.
as follows

SolrQuery solrQuery = new  SolrQuery().
    setQuery("ipod").
    setFacet(true).
    setFacetMinCount(1).
    setFacetLimit(8).
    addFacetField("category").
    addFacetField("inStock");
