SOLR-2008 fixed a possible RejectedExecutionException by ensuring that SolrCore closed the updateHandler before the searcherExecutor.

Mark Miller re-flipped this logic in r1159378, which is annotated as fixing both SOLR-2654 and SOLR-2654 (dup typo i guess) but it's not clear why - pretty sure this means that the risk of a Rejected exception is back in 4.0-BETA...
