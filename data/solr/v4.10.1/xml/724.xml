                <project id="12310230" key="SOLR">Solr</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Exposing them precludes being ever able to fill the CoreDescriptor with property expressions.&lt;br/&gt;
Since a &apos;public&apos; method can not be removed easily, this is a future problem.&lt;br/&gt;
Besides, as is, their is no reason for them to be public.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="12625277" author="shalinmangar" created="Mon, 25 Aug 2008 09:39:05 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;I think you mean get/set coreProperties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a problem. These methods can continue to be used for properties (evaluated expressions). We can always keep another object for un-evaluated expressions for persisting them back.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12625287" author="henrib" created="Mon, 25 Aug 2008 10:25:00 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;Yes, correct; properties, not expressions.&lt;br/&gt;
They are unnecessary since the CoreContainer &amp;amp; each SolrCore resource loader could (will hopefully) contain the evaluated properties.&lt;br/&gt;
That would make 2 places where we can access them &amp;amp; this seems redundant.&lt;br/&gt;
I&apos;m just trying to reduce public method exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12625289" author="noble.paul" created="Mon, 25 Aug 2008 10:33:26 +0100"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m just trying to reduce public method exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no harm is exposing methods as long as we are exposing immutable stuff. It can actually enable a lot of components to get information w/o raising new issues in JIRA&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12625305" author="henrib" created="Mon, 25 Aug 2008 10:55:50 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m confused about when the &apos;what-if&apos; rule can apply or not wrt public methods.&lt;br/&gt;
My understanding was that till a use-case exists, we shouldn&apos;t publicly expose the method ( and it&apos;s been quite a hard lesson... &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt; )&lt;br/&gt;
Besides, the SolrResourceLoader &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; available from everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12625319" author="noble.paul" created="Mon, 25 Aug 2008 12:12:13 +0100"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides, the SolrResourceLoader is available from everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But , if there is something private in that class it should be fine . right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My understanding was that till a use-case exists..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Solr is also an API there are a lot of requesthandlers which people write may find some info useful. We can go one step ahead and think &quot;will it hurt if this is public?&quot; . Moreover , even if something is private I can easily access the value through reflection. So the kind of security it offers is just not real&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only advantage I see is that , if you wish to remove something it is easy if something is not public. So if some feature is experimental it can be kept not public&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question to ask before making things public is that can the user can alter some state in a way that can affect the functionality. If it is purely a read-only state I guess it should be OK&lt;/p&gt;

In this issue, I&apos;m stating that exposing Properties in the CoreDescriptor is hindering future evolution because they will have to be maintained, that the same information should be available from what I consider a narrower scope location that does not reduce the  functional possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="12625369" author="shalinmangar" created="Mon, 25 Aug 2008 15:21:08 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;I feel that CoreContainer and CoreDescriptor seem to be the most logical place to &lt;b&gt;find&lt;/b&gt; the properties since they directly correspond to the &amp;lt;solr&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;core&amp;gt; elements in solr.xml and SolrResourceLoader is the most logical place to &lt;b&gt;use&lt;/b&gt; them since that&apos;s what we use to load config files. I think it should be OK to keep both the ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12625377" author="henrib" created="Mon, 25 Aug 2008 15:37:56 +0100"  >
&lt;p&gt;Obviously different &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In my mind, these are resources of the core-container / cores; resources are accessed through their respective ResourceLoader.&lt;br/&gt;
And the CoreDescriptor is, at its name hints, a parameter; it should not play any active role besides carrying data to create a SolrCore (and should not be used beyond that role).&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="12625390" author="markrmiller@gmail.com" created="Mon, 25 Aug 2008 16:02:04 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;I agree with Henri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having these methods public ties core properties to the CoreDescriptor for no apparent good reason. This has the possibility of being an annoyance down the road. Unless specifically needed, why create this burden? Keeping the link between core properties and the descriptor package private allows for more flexibility in the future - and will keep users happier - we don&apos;t want to have to deprecate and change user exposed APIs if we can help it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My understanding was that till a use-case exists, we shouldn&apos;t publicly expose the method ( and it&apos;s been quite a hard lesson...  )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a great rule of thumb, and should be the guiding principal here. Whats the use case that this solves beyond what using the resource loader provides? The benefit should clearly outweigh having to maintain/support the public API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another question to ask before making things public is that can the user can alter some state in a way that can affect the functionality. If it is purely a read-only state I guess it should be OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it goes further than this - there is a public link between the descriptor and the core properties. Its not a huge issue obviously, but there should be good reason for publicly linking two classes I think - the fact that the implementation contains the linked class privately doesn&apos;t seem like a very good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bowing down to public demand &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the methods to package private to insulate the public API from internal changes.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
