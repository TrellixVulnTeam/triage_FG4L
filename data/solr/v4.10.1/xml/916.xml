            <title>[SOLR-916] CoreContainer :: register(String, SolrCore, boolean)  documentation clarification about returnPrev argument</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-916</link>
                <project id="12310230" key="SOLR">Solr</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In CoreContainer.java :: register(name, core, returnPrev) - the documentation says &lt;br/&gt;
  it would return a previous core having the same name if it existed &lt;b&gt;and returnPrev = true&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;@return a previous core having the same name if it existed and returnPrev==true&lt;br/&gt;
  */&lt;br/&gt;
 public SolrCore register(String name, SolrCore core, boolean returnPrev) ..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But as per the code towards the end - the previous core is returned anyway, irrespective of the value of returnPrev. The difference, though, seems to be that when returnPrev is false, the previous core (of the same name, if exists) is closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which one of them is correct . If the code were correct , would the variable be better renamed as closePrevious , as opposed to returnPrevious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The name change certainly makes some sense, but even as is, a core that is returned closed is not very useful. Null could just as well be returned. But when you ask to returnPrev, a working open core is guaranteed to be returned if a previous one existed. I wouldnt feel so bad leaving it as it is - your change almost seems to strengthen the contract - you have to return the closed core as well. Neither side is a very strong argument to me and I could go either way.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do not have an issue with the logic ( closing an existing core if returnPrev is false ) as it is currently but am more concerned with the name of the variable and the documentation about the same - just to make sure that it is in sync with the actual logic as of today. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12711599" author="markrmiller@gmail.com" created="Thu, 21 May 2009 13:39:35 +0100"  >&lt;p&gt;I would say that if returnPrev is false, what is returned is undefined. The closed core is returned, but it just as well could be null. If the user expects to get and be able to use the prevCore, he must pass returnPrev = true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It still makes sense to me, but I wouldn&apos;t object to the change if someone wants to put it in.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I disagree. The name of the variable does not reflect the actual underlying behavior .  We need the documentation change as well as an appropriate name of the variable fitting the current behavior. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
