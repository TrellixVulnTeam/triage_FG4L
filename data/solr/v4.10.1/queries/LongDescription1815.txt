Using Solrj, I wanted to sort the response of a range query based on some specific labels. For instance, using the query:


facet=true
&facet.query={!key= Less than 100}[* TO 99]
&facet.query={!key=100 - 200}[100 TO 200]
&facet.query={!key=200 +}[201 TO *]



I wanted to display the response in the following order:


Less than 100 (x)
100 - 200 (y)
201 + (z)



independently on the values of x, y, z which are the numbers of the retrieved documents for each range.

While Solr itself produces correctly the desired order (as specified in my query), SolrJ doesn't preserve it. 

RE: Yonik, a solution could be just to change


_facetQuery = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
    ...to...
_facetQuery = new Linked HashMap<String, Integer>();
