admin screen in trunk currently links to /admin/file/?file=schema.xml and /admin/file/?file=solrconfig.xml by defualt and expects the config to map /admin/file to ShowFileRequestHandler ... this isn't backwards compatible for Solr 1.2 users.

we should put some extra logic in SolrCore.init to automaticly register an instance of ShowFileRequestHandler if there is a <gettableFiles> section in solrconfig.xml and no instnces of ShowFileRequestHandler are already registered (with a warning logged about <gettableFiles> being deprecated)
