"I believe there is a bug in IndexBased- and FileBasedSpellChecker.java
where the analyzer variable is only set on the build command. Therefore,
when the index is reloaded, but not built after starting solr, issuing a
query with the spellcheck.q parameter will cause a NullPointerException to
be thrown (SpellCheckComponent.java:158). Moving the analyzer logic to the
constructor seems to fix the problem."
