Query strings that contain a single quote, properly escaped, break as soon as you add a sort field.

For example,
If  I want to search for the word ----   jam's   ---- 
including the single quote, I can.  But as soon as I add a sort criteria to the URL, it breaks.

Note: %27 is a single quote encoded for URI's

Here's the examples....
http://10.0.101.11:8080/forsale/select/?q=jam%27s    – this works (i get ~20 hits back)
http://10.0.101.11:8080/forsale/select/?q=jam%27s;score%20desc — this doesn't (get 0 hits back)

Seems that if the first query works, it shouldn't be breakable just by telling it explicitly to sort on score??  All other sorts break in this scenario as well ( i.e., price, etc).

email rsp from Yonik:
Hmmm, Solr tries to be smart about splitting the query from the sort
specification.
If it sees a semicolon inside quotes (single or double), or backslash
escaped, then it will treat it as part of the query.

An immediate workaround would be to query for "jam's" or jam\'s

It would be helpful if you could open a JIRA issue for this.
