Minor nit I noticed while looking at the SolrResourceLoader:
When the instanceDir is null upon constructing a SolrResourceLoader, normalizeDir is called twice, once by locateInstanceDir, and then again in the constructor.  

Patch to follow that also adds some docs on it and a simple unit test, etc.
