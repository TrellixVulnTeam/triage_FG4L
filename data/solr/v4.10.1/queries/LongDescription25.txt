LUCENE-605 added a new ComplexExplanation class to the Lucene core which allows for Explanations of queries which match documents with non-positive scores â€“ somethign that can happen quite a bit with FunctionQueries.

Here is a patch to make FunctionQuery take advantage of the new CompelxExplanation class if you are using a bleeding edge version of lucene-core.

This patch can be commited in Solr once we're ready to rev lib/lucene-core-nightly.jar again.
