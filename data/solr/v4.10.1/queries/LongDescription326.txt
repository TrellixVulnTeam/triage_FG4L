On default settings, Eclipse had 628 warnings.  This patch removes 119 of those warnings related to unused imports.  These are the safest warnings to fix and shouldn't require any testing other than confirming building still works.  

The general idea of removing warnings is both cleaner code, but also making it easier for interesting warnings to get hidden by uninteresting warnings.
