The evaluator parameter syntax is not well defined and inconsistent in some places. This issue aims to standardize on the following:

	String parameters should be enclosed in a single quote
	Variables can be written as-is
	Numbers (integers or floats) can be written as-is



We will enforce this among the existing evaluators and provide helper functions for this parsing which future implementations can use.
