In a few special cases, it makes sense for a single "field" (the concept) to be indexed as a set of Fields (lucene Field).  Consider SOLR-773.  The concept "point" may be best indexed in a variety of ways:

	geohash (sincle lucene field)
	lat field, lon field (two double fields)
	cartesian tiers (a series of fields with tokens to say if it exists within that region)
