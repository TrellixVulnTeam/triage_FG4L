When you query a number field
locally, it can return null. However, when you go through a shard if
you have an empty number it throws an error. 

I found wrapping the BinaryResponseWrite with a try/catch solved the
problem and allows null values to be returned.

BinaryResponseWriter.java:141
        try 
{
          val = useFieldObjects ? ft.toObject(f) : ft.toExternal(f);
        }
 catch (NumberFormatException e) 
{
        val = null;
        }

It seems only the BinaryResponseWriter is actually that fussy about
null items. Once it comes back to the client for display, it is
handled without error. 

Hoss suggested this should be fixed for 1.3 but now that it has shipped I have marked it as 1.3.1 (
