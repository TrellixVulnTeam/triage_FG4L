It is likely that a file is different in master and slave. for instance replicating solrconfig.xml is not possible with the current config if master and slave has diffferent solrconfig.xml (which is always true)

We can add an alias feature in the confFiles as


<str name="confFiles">slave_solrconfig.xml:solrconfig.xml,slave_schema.xml:schema.xml</str>


This means that the file slave_solrconfig.xml should be copied to the slave as solrconfig.xml and slave_schema.xml must be saved to slave as schema.xml
