MultiCore should require a core name in the URL.  If the core name is missing, there should be a 404, not a valid core.  That is:
http://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=*:*  should return 404.

While we are at it, we should cleanup the DispatchHandler.  Perhaps the best approach is to treat single core as multicore with only one core?  As is the tangle of potential paths is ugly.
