It can be very useful to reuse the output from a DIH template in other templates and or regex transformers. Currently this cannot be done. The resolver is initialized at the start of the transformer run with what ever values exist for a column name at that instant. As the transformer executes it may define new values for column names. My change is intended to update the hash used by the resolver after each successful transformation.

This only applies to the template and regex transformers.
