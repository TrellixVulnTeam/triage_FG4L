ps: illegal option â€“ f
usage: ps [-AaCcEefhjlMmrSTvwXx] [-O fmt | -o fmt] [-G gid[,gid...]]
          [-u]
          [-p pid[,pid...]] [-t tty[,tty...]] [-U user[,user...]]
       ps [-L]

MacOSX does not support the -f option to show all the command line arguments.  This is the default behavior for ps (on OSX, but can be supressed with -c).
It also doesn't much like -wwwu $user.  Wants -www -U $user.
