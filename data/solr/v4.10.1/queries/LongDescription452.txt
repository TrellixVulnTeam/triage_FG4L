Lucene's highlighter capability allows for the merging of contiguous fragments.  Currently, Solr has this hard-coded to false.  The patch to follow changes this behavior to allow it to be set in the solrconfig.xml highlighter section.

This can be handled via:
<int name="hl.mergeContiguous">true</int>

The default value is false, as is the current way of doing it.
