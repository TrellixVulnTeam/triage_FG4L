Currently there is no way to perform a delta import per entity because $
{dataimporter.last_index_time}
 really represents the entire delta-import for all entities and is only a single dataimport.properties file.

A delta-import w/ dataimport?command=delta-import&entity=a and dataimport?command=delta-import&entity=b should result in:

$
{dataimporter.[name of entity].last_index_time}
${dataimporter.[name of entity].last_index_time}

I do this now because I have a single multicore representing different docs coming from different entities.
