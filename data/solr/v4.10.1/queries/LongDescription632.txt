The Jetty that is bundled for the example application is version 6.1.3, which is over a year old.

We should upgrade Jetty to the latest, 6.1.11.

I am not sure how to attach a patch to remove files, so these are the steps :

Using as base the root of 'apache-solr-nightly':

DELETE:
example/lib/jetty-6.1.3.jar
example/lib/jetty-util-6.1.3.jar
example/lib/servlet-api-2.5-6.1.3.jar

ADD
example/lib/jetty-6.1.11.jar
example/lib/jetty-util-6.1.11.jar
example/lib/servlet-api-2.5-6.1.11.jar

â€”
The files to be added can be found in Jetty's binary distribution file :
http://dist.codehaus.org/jetty/jetty-6.1.11/jetty-6.1.11.zip

I couldn't find any noticeable changes in jetty.xml that should be carried over.
