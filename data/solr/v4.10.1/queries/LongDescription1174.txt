See SOLR-554 for the original improvement.

This has a bug in it.  If I submit the form using multicore, it goes to /solr/admin/logging (not the right path).

I'm guessing this is because of the path trickery in SolrDispathFilter but I can't follow what the best procedure is to fix it.

The simplest thing to do is to not use request.getRequestURI() because a form with no action submits to itself.
