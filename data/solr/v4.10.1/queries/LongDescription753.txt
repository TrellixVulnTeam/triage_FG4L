for single core ,the  CoreDescriptor is instantiated with the following code

CoreDescriptor dcore = new CoreDescriptor(cores, "", cfg.getResourceLoader().getInstanceDir());


and the reload in CoreContainer#create(CoreDescriptor dcore) has a snippet as follows


File idir = new File(loader.getInstanceDir(), dcore.getInstanceDir());



which will make the idir value something like "solr/solr/" which is wrong
