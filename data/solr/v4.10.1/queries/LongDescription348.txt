all code in the core handlers that operates on the DocSet or DocList produced from a "main" serach should be smart enough to give up immediately when the DocList/DocSet is empty.

optimizations could be put in the handlers, but the definitely need to be put in the utility classes (so consumer written handlers benefit as well)
