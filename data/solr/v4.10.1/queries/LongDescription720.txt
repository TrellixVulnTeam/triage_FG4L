CoreContainer.persist() writes the core container properties at the 'wrong' place in the XML.
A Solr webapp with a solr.xml stating persistent='true' may fail to restart if the file is written.
They should be written under /solr - not /solr/cores aka before (not after):

  /** Write the cores configuration through a writer.*/
  void persist(Writer writer) throws IOException {
...
    writer.write("<cores adminPath='");
...
