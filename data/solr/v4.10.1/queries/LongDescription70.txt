while reviewing SOLR-58 i noticed that ping.jsp is extremely naive about the types of requests it can use to sanity check the index, in particular:

	it treats the first query param that starts with "q" as the query string (like for example "qt")
	it ignores all other query params



...this makes it worthless to try and configure anything but the standard querest handler with no options as your ping URL.
