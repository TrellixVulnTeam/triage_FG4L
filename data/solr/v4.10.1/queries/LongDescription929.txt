There appears to be an error in the admin interface (/solr/admin/schema.jsp) when using a '*' field in a schema.  In the example
schema.xml, there is a commented out sample:


 
  <!-- uncomment the following to ignore any fields that don't
already match an existing
       field name or dynamic field, rather than reporting them as an error.
       alternately, change the type="ignored" to some other type e.g.
"text" if you want
       unknown fields indexed and/or stored by default -->
  <!--dynamicField name="*" type="ignored" /-->

 

We have this un-commented, and in the schema browser via the admin interface I see that all non-dynamic fields get a type of "ignored".

for example, I see this in the Solr admin interface:

Field: uid
Dynamically Created From Pattern: *
Field Type: ignored

though the field definition is:

 
  <field name="uid"  type="integer" indexed="true" stored="true"/>
