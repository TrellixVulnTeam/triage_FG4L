It should be possible to specify dataDir directly for a core in solr.xml (over and above specifying it as a variable). It should also be possible to pass the dataDir as a request parameter while creating a core through the REST API.

A simple scenario which requires this feature is when the location of the data directory depends on runtime parameters (such as free disk space or number of directories inside a directory).
