a couple of new facet params:
facet lists become pageable with facet.offset, facet.limit  (idea from Erik)
facet.sort explicitly specifies sort order (true for count descending, false for natural index order)
facet.mincount: minimum count for facets included in response (idea from JJ, deprecate zeros)
