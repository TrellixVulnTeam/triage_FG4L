The tutorial says:
"[after the update] numDoc should be 15..."
My stats pages, however, displays the following information: "numDocs : 16"

Going though the xml files in exampledocs, it's obvious there's 16 different IDs: it's just that the tutorial makes a point of there being only 15 documents (no duplicates) so it might confuse the reader.
