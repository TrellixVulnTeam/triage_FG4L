SpellingQueryConverter throws NPE when used with q.alt=:

The issue being the String original will be passed as null when q.alt=:. I think the required behavior should be when original string is null, just return the empty result.

Here is the code snippet with suggested change

  public Collection<Token> convert(String original) {
    Collection<Token> result = new ArrayList<Token>();
    if(original ==null){ //usecase with q.alt=*:*
    	return result;
    }
