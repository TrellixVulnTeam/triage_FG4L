When doing an HTTP request to a Solr Server using the shards parameter ("shards") the behavior of the response varies.

The following requests cause the entire document (all fields) to return in the response:

    http://localhost:8180/solr/cpaCore/select/?q=*:*
    http://localhost:8180/solr/cpaCore/select/?q=*:*&fl=score
    http://localhost:8180/solr/cpaCore/select/?q=*:*&shards=shardLocation/solr/cpaCore

The following request causes only the fields "id" and "score" to return in the response:

    http://localhost:8180/solr/cpaCore/select/?q=*:*&fl=score&shards=shardLocation/solr/cpaCore

I don't know if this is by design but it does provide for some inconsistent behavior, as shard requests behave differently than regular requests.
