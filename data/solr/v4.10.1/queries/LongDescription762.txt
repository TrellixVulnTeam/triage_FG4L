RAT (http://incubator.apache.org/rat/) is a useful tool for checking we are in good shape for releases.  It has Ant support.  This patch adds it to the build.xml.

In order for you to run it, you need the RAT app jar and the RAT ant tasks jar in your ant/lib.  The other tasks should still work even if those jars are not present.
