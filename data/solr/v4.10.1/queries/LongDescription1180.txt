Entity is set up in db-data-config.xml as follows

I<entity dataSource="mysqlDS" name="contact" pk="id"
    query="SELECT o.* FROM Contact o WHERE (o.deleted is null OR o.deleted = 0)"
    deltaQuery="select id from Contact o where (o.deleted is null OR o.deleted = 0) AND (o.createDate > '$
{dataimporter.last_index_time}' OR o.updateDate > '${dataimporter.last_index_time}
')"
    deletedPkQuery="select id FROM Contact o WHERE o.deleted = 1 AND (o.createDate > '$
{dataimporter.last_index_time}' OR o.updateDate > '${dataimporter.last_index_time}
')">
    ...
</entity>

If a delta import is trigger which causes only documents to be deleted the index is not commit. 

Problem seems to be in DocBuilder.execute() method checks for deletedDocCount before commiting.
if (importStatistics.docCount.get() > 0 || importStatistics.deletedDocCount.get() > 0) 
{
  commit(lastIndexTimeProps);
}

doDelta() method sets the count as follows
importStatistics.deletedDocCount.addAndGet(deletedKeys.size());

but after deleteAll(Set) method removes the each key from iterator
while (...) ...
      iter.remove();

Simply remove iter.remove() line should fix the problem. I am not sure what is the point of removing the keys from the iterator.
