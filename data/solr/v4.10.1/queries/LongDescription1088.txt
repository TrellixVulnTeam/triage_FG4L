Noted on the mailing list while investigating something semi-related, the method SolrCore.newSearcher(String name, boolean readOnly) doesn't work as advertised (the readOnly option is completely ignored)

the method isn't used anywhere in Solr (that i could find) but it might be used by clients ... we should deal with this in some way prior to the 1.4 release (either fix; fix & deprecate; or document problem and deprecate)
