The current replication strategy in solr involves shell scripts . The following are the drawbacks with the approach

	It does not work with windows
	Replication works as a separate piece not integrated with solr.
	Cannot control replication from solr admin/JMX
	Each operation requires manual telnet to the host



Doing the replication in java has the following advantages

	Platform independence
	Manual steps can be completely eliminated. Everything can be driven from solrconfig.xml .
	
		Adding the url of the master in the slaves should be good enough to enable replication. Other things like frequency of
snapshoot/snappull can also be configured . All other information can be automatically obtained.
	
	
	Start/stop can be triggered from solr/admin or JMX
	Can get the status/progress while replication is going on. It can also abort an ongoing replication
	No need to have a login into the machine
	From a development perspective, we can unit test it



This issue can track the implementation of solr replication in java
