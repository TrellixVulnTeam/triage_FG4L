an offhand comment I saw recently reminded me of something that really bugged me about the serach solution i used before Solr â€“ it didn't play nicely with HTTP caches that might be sitting in front of it.

at the moment, Solr doesn't put in particularly usefull info in the HTTP Response headers to aid in caching (ie: Last-Modified), responds to all HEAD requests with a 400, and doesn't do anything special with If-Modified-Since.

t the very least, we can set a Last-Modified based on when the current IndexReder was open (if not the Date on the IndexReader) and use the same info to determing how to respond to If-Modified-Since requests.

(for the record, i think the reason this hasn't occured to me in the 2+ years i've been using Solr, is because with the internal caching, i've yet to need to put a proxy cache in front of Solr)
