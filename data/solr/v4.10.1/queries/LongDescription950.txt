When issuing a distributed request, the aggregator node caused an exception due to the following code at line 99 in FacetComponent.java


 if (refList == null | refList.size()==0) continue;



 note the single pipe for a bitwise OR rather than boolean OR

Change code to:


if (refList == null || refList.size() == 0) continue;
