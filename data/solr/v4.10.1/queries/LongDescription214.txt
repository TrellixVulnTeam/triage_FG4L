After SOLR-197 is applied, POSTed Japanese XML contents turn into garbled characters in the index.
I can see the garbled characters through Luke. The issue was never seen before SOLR-197.
The cause of this problem is that the deficit of InputStreamReader support in the anonymous class of ContentStream in SolrRequestParsers.parseParamsAndFillStreams() method.

Before SOLR-197, InputStreamReader was used in XmlUpdateRequestHandler.handleRequestBody() method:

    // Cycle through each stream
    for( ContentStream stream : req.getContentStreams() ) {
      String charset = getCharsetFromContentType( stream.getContentType() );
      Reader reader = null;
      if( charset == null ) 
{
        reader = new InputStreamReader( stream.getStream() );
      }
      else 
{
        reader = new InputStreamReader( stream.getStream(), charset );
      }
      rsp.add( "update", this.update( reader ) );

      // Make sure its closed
      try 
{ reader.close(); }
 catch( Exception ex ){}
    }

The patch will apply this effect to SolrRequestParsers.
