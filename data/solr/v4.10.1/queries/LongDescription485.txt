The current spellchecker does not handle multiword queries very well, if at all.  Depending on the settings, it either ignores multiword tokens, or it splits on whitespace.  It should use the query analyzer associated with the spelling field to produce tokens for spelling.

We should deprecate the current one and replace it with one that is similar, but does the appropriate thing with the query tokens.
