It appears to me that the spell-check component can't build a dictionary based on phonetic similarity (i.e. using a Phonetic analysis filter). Sure, you can go ahead and configure the spell check component to use a field type that uses a phonetic filter but the suggestions presented to the user are based on the indexed values (i.e. phonemes), not the original words.  Thus the user will be presented with a suggested phoneme which is a poor user experience.  It's not clear how this shortcoming could be rectified because for a given phoneme, there are potentially multiple words to choose from that could be encoded to a given phoneme.  Ideally the more popular occurrence would be chosen but I'm not sure how this would be implemented.
