Refer to Patrick's comment on SOLR-469 at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-469?focusedCommentId=12604276#action_12604276 and report by Tom at http://www.nabble.com/localsolr-and-dataimport-problems-tp18849983p18849983.html

DataImportHandler directly uses the core.getUpdateHandler (DirectUpdateHandler2) instead of going through the UpdateRequestProcessor API. This makes it impossible to utilize update processors with DataImportHandler.
