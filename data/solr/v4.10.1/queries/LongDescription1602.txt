Currently all o.a.solr.request.QueryResponseWriter implementations are curiously located in the o.a.solr.request package. Not only is this package getting big (30+ classes), a lot of them are misplaced. There should be a first-class o.a.solr.response package, and the response related classes should be given a home there. Patch forthcoming.
