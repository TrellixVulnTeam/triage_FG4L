The current implementation of setIncludeScore(boolean) adds the value "score" to the FL parameter.
This causes a problem when using the setFields followed by include score.
If I do this:

setFields("*");
setIncludeScore(true);

I would expect the outcome to be "fl=*,score"
Instead the outcome is: "fl=* &fl=score" which fails to use the score field as FL is not a multi-valued field.

The current implementation in the SolrJ SolrQuery object is:
add("fl", "score")
instead it should be:
set("fl", get("fl") + ",score")

obviously not as simplistic as that, but you catch my drift...
