This is a super-easy request for a Solr commiter to do.  Look at line 187 of FieldType.  It catches NumberFormatException (a subtype of RuntimeException) when calling toInternal() in order to throw a SolrException that has useful information â€“ namely the field attempting to be set and its value.  The caught exception should be declared to be very broudly at RuntimeException since problems other than NumberFormatException might occur.  An example is SolrException thrown by DateField when parsing fails.
