In the above thread, it was suggested to extend the SpellingQueryConverter to cover the full UTF-8 range instead of handling US-ASCII only. This might be as simple as changing the regular expression used to tokenize the input string to accept a sequence of one or more Unicode letters ( \p
{L}
+ ) instead of a sequence of one or more word characters ( \w+ ).

See http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html for Java regular expression reference.
