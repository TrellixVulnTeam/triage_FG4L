For some embedded applications, it is useful to call solr without running an HTTP server.  This class mimics the behavior you would get if you sent the request through an HTTP connection.  It is designed to work nicely (ie simple) with JNI

the main function is:

public class DirectSolrConnection 
{
  String request( String pathAndParams, String body ) throws Exception
  {
    ...
  }
}
