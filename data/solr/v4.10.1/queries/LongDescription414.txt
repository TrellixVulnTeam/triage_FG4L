We currently load many plugins with a Map or NamedList â€“ since SOLR-215, the current core is not available through SolrCore.getSolrCore() and may need to be used for initialization.

Ideally, we could change the init() methods from:

void init( final Map<String,String> args );

to

void init( final SolrCore core, final Map<String,String> args );


Without breaking existing APIs, this change is difficult (some ugly options exist).  This patch offers a solution to keep existing 1.2 APIs, and allow access to the SolrConfig and SolrCore though ThreadLocal.  This should be removed in a future release.


  DeprecatedPluginUtils.getCurrentCore();
  DeprecatedPluginUtils.getCurrentConfig();



This patch removes the SolrConfig.Initalizable that was introduced in SOLR-215.
