Add ability to optionally splitOnNumerics WordDelimiterFilter/Factory

Default behaviour is to splitOnNumerics as WordDelimiterFilter/Factory does now

I was having issues with e.g. Java/J2SE becoming split into tokens 'Java','J' '2' and 'SE'  which isn't desired behavior in my instance, I wanted this to be tokens 'Java', 'J2SE'. Another option I thought about but not implemented was to have a protected list of words like solr.EnglishPorterFilterFactory
