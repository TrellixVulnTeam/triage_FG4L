as we are using java5 .we can use annotations to bind SolrDocument to java beans directly.

This can make the usage of solrj a  bit simpler

The QueryResponse class in solrj can have an extra method as follows

public <T> List<T> getResultBeans(Class<T> klass)

and the bean can have annotations as

class MyBean{
@Field("id") //name is optional
String id;

@Field("category")
List<String> categories
}
