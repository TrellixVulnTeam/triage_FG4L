the problem is in this block:

    public void addedDocument() {
      docsSinceCommit++;
      lastAddedTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
      if( pending == null ) {  // Don't start a new event if one is already waiting 
        if( timeUpperBound > 0 ) 
{ 
          pending = scheduler.schedule( this, timeUpperBound, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS );
        }
        else if( docsUpperBound > 0 && (docsSinceCommit > docsUpperBound) ) 
{
          // 1/4 second seems fast enough for anyone using maxDocs
          pending = scheduler.schedule( this, 250, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS );
        }
      }
    }

the docSinceCommit block is not triggered as a (long waiting) pending commit scheduled for maxTime.
