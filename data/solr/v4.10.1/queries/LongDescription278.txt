the soon to be attached patch adds a method to LukeRequest to set the option for showing schema from SOLR-266.  the patch also modifies LukeRepsonse to handle the schema info in the same manner as the fields from the 'normal' luke response.  i think it's worth talking about unifying the response format so that they aren't different but that's a larger discussion.
