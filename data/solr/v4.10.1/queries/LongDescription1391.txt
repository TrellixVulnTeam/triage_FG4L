If you have a data-import configuration that nests an entity that includes an XPath with an XPathEntityProcessor - like so :- 

<entity name="a" ...etc
  datasource="
  <field column="xpath_value"/>

  <entity name="b" 
        dataSource="filereader"
        processor="XPathEntityProcessor"
        ... etc />

      <field column="my_field" xpath="$
{a.xpath_value}" />
  </entity>

</entity>

This will fail with an error like so

Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: xpath must start with '/' : ${a.xpath_value}

We should allow the xpath to be replaced with the token from entity a
