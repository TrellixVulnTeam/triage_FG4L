solr is able to find snapshooter but didn't  generate any snapshot files after the index is updated. I checked the
log, everything looks fine, then I run snapshooter from command line. It failed because Solaris doesn't support 
-l option for cp command. I changed command "cp -lr dir1 dir2" to:

mkdir dir2
ln dir1/* dir2

It seems working. Otis suggested to create an issue so that Bill Au & Co. can fix this problem. 
Please note: several other commands under solr/bin also have this problem. You can use grep "cp -lr" to find all of them 
and make similar changes.

I'm also curious why there is no error log when solr failed running snapshooter. Shouldn't solr log an error message?

Thanks
