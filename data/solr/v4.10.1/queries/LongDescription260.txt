As we talk about adding more configuration (Handlers, Highlighting, Components, etc) we should standardize the format and share the loading and initialization code.

This patch extracts the common stuff from SOLR-225 and makes it work with the RequestHandler framework.

This is an abstract base class â€“ each implementation needs to take care of actually creating and initializing the instances:

abstract class PluginLoader<T>
{
  abstract public T create( String className, NamedList args, Map<String,String> params );

  abstract public void init( T plugin, NamedList args, Map<String,String> params );

  public Map<String,T> load( NodeList nodes )
  {
    ...
  }
}
