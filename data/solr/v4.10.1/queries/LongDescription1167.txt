Current configuration files (schema and solrconfig) are monolithic which can make maintenance and reuse more difficult that it needs to be.  The XML standards include a feature to include content from external files.  This is described at http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/

This feature is to add support for XInclude features for XML configuration files.
