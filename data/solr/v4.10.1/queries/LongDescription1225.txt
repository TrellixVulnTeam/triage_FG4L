Currently the LukeRequestHandler is calling: 
 int docCount = searcher.numDocs( q, matchAllDocs ); 
followed by:
 DocList ds = searcher.getDocList( q, (Query)null, (Sort)null, 0, 1 );
to get the doc count (and then the first doc returned)

This can be replaced with:
 TopDocs top = searcher.search( q, 1 );
