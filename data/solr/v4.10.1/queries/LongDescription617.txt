Lucene API provides means to configure deletion policy. Solr should be able to expose it through configuration in solrconfig.xml. Moreover the new replication (SOLR-561) strategy is going to rely on this .

I propose the configuration go into the <mainIndex>  section

sample configuration
solrconfig.xml
<mainIndex>
    <!-- configure deletion policy here-->
    <deletionPolicy>
       <!-- Store only the commits with optimize.Non optimized commits will get deleted by lucene when 
               the last IndexWriter/IndexReader using this commit point is closed  -->
        <keepOptimizedOnly>true</keepOptimizedOnly>
         <!--Maximum no: of commit points stored . Older ones will be cleaned when they go out of scope-->
        <maxCommitsToKeep></maxCommitsToKeep>
         <!-- max age of a stored commit-->
        <maxCommitAge></maxCommitAge>    
    </deletionPolicy>
    
  </mainIndex>
