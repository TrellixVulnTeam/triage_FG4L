In a lot of cases we do not actually need the data included in the
header.So we just waste bandwidth, processing to write and read this .

And there are requests where the responses are quite small and too frequent  (say for auto-suggest feature) where this overhead is unnecessary

we should add a request parameter omitHeader=true|false . Default
should be false . If it is true let us not send the header itself
