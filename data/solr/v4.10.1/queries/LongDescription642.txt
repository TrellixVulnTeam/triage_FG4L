As ShardResponse is package protected, any class that makes extention 
of a search component has access issues due to different classloaders.

"java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access class
org.apache.solr.handler.component.ShardResponse from class
org.apache.solr.handler.component.MyComponent"

The proposed solution (see Yonik answer on solr-dev) :
 1. A public scope for the ShardResponse (a class of it's own)
 2. Switch public members to private and use getters for the search components
