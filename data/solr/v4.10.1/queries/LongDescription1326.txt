There is no way for a plugin to know the information of the attributes mentioned in the tag itself (like name). We should have a new interface to initialize with PluginInfo such as 


public interface PluginInfoInitialized{
  public void init(PluginInfo pluginInfo);
}


The PluginInfo class has been enhanced to allow sub components as well. So the current syntax of UpdateprocessorChain/highlighter can also be supported by implementing this interface .
