Expose the Lucene contrib SpellChecker as a Search Component. Provide the following features:

	Allow creating a spell index on a given field and make it possible to have multiple spell indices â€“ one for each field
	Give suggestions on a per-field basis
	Given a multi-word query, give only one consistent suggestion
	Process the query with the same analyzer specified for the source field and process each token separately
	Allow the user to specify minimum length for a token (optional)



Consistency criteria for a multi-word query can consist of the following:

	Preserve the correct words in the original query as it is
	Never give duplicate words in a suggestion
