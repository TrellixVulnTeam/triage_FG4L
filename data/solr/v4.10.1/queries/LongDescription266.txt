The LukeRequestHandler currently just shows info for fields it finds in the index.  It could also show info for fields in the schema.  This patch adds:

  http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/luke?show=schema

showing a list of all fields defined by the schema followed by the types and what fields use the types (if any)

This is helpful for client apps to know what fields are available and is also a good sanity check to see what fields solr knows about after parsing the schema.xml.  Chasing down xml parsing can be difficult:
