Problem doing a delta-import such that records marked as "deleted" in the database are removed from Solr using deletedPkQuery.

Here's a config I'm using against a mocked test database:



<dataConfig>
 <dataSource driver="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" url="jdbc:mysql://localhost/db"/>
 <document name="tests">
   <entity name="test"
           pk="board_id"
           transformer="TemplateTransformer"
           deletedPkQuery="select board_id from boards where deleted = 'Y'"
           query="select * from boards where deleted = 'N'"
           deltaImportQuery="select * from boards where deleted = 'N'"
           deltaQuery="select * from boards where deleted = 'N'"
           preImportDeleteQuery="datasource:board">
     <field column="id" template="board-${test.board_id}"/>
     <field column="datasource" template="board"/>
     <field column="title" />
   </entity>
 </document>
</dataConfig>



Note that the uniqueKey in Solr is the "id" field.  And its value is a template board-<PK>.

I noticed the javadoc comments in DocBuilder#collectDelta it says "Note: In our definition, unique key of Solr document is the primary key of the top level entity".  This of course isn't really an appropriate assumption.
