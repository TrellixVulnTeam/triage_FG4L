When something goes wrong in solr configuration, I want solr to stop working and loudly say "something went wrong"  This patch adds a collection of severe errors to SolrConfig.  If abortOnConfigurationError=true and there are errors, the SolrDispatchFilter prints out a nice message saying "hey something went wrong!"

The specific things that were hidden in error files that will now give dramatic error are:

	unknown class for RequestHandler/ResponseWriter
	any exception throw during handler/writer init()



If you want to disable this behavior (perhaps for a production environment) you need to add:
  <abortOnConfigurationError>false</abortOnConfigurationError>
to solrconfig.xml
