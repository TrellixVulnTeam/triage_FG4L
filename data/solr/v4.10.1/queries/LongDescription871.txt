Currently we we use a custom library to make a XMLInputFactory â€“ we can use the standard one.

-    inputFactory = BaseXMLInputFactory.newInstance();
+    inputFactory = XMLInputFactory.newInstance();



This will remove a dependency on stax-util.jar and let people running java6 package solr without any stax libraries.
