the idea has been discussed numerous times that it would be nice if there was a way to configure a core to load plugins from specific jars (or "classes" style directories) by path  w/o needing to copy them to the "./lib" dir in the instanceDir.

The current workaround is "symlinks" but that doesn't really help the situation of the Solr Release artifacts, where we wind up making numerous copies of jars to support multiple example directories (you can't have reliable symlinks in zip files)
