This is a requirement for java based Solr replication 

Usecase for arbitrary index directory:
if the slave has a corrupted index and the filesystem does not allow overwriting files in use (NTFS) replication will fail. The solution is to copy the index from master to an alternate directory on slave and load indexreader/indexwriter from this alternate directory.
