The firstSearcher and newSearcher events call the regular search component chain, but are special cases.  They should identify themselves by passing in a parameter indicating their type.  This way, for instance, the sharding component could know to ignore the &shards parameter, which currently causes Solr to hang if it is present in the firstSearcher query string.
