Versions in use/compared:
Solr 1.3
(Nightly 5th August)
Nightly 22nd September

As RegexTransformer is not different between the two nightlies, the
issue probably appeared before.

ISSUE:
Using RegexTransformer with the 'sourceColName' notation will not populate
multiValued (actually containing multiple values) fields with a list but
instead add only one value per document.

The version with 'groupNames' does.

worked for 1.3 (regression):
<field column="participant" sourceColName="person" regex="([^\|]+)|.*" />
<field column="role" sourceColName="person"
regex="[^\|]|\d,\d+,\d+,(.*)" />


works for nightly 22nd Sept:
<field column="person" groupNames="participant,role"
regex="([^\|])|\d,\d+,\d+,(.*)" />

(Both fields are of type solr.StrField and multiValued.)


Comparing the source code of RegexTransformer 1.3 vs. 22nd Sept, I found:

for (Object result : results)
         row.put(col, result);

(lines 106-107 of transformRow() 22nd of Sept)
