Need a way to rapidly do a bulk update of a single field for use as a component in a function query (no need to be able to search on it).
Idea: create an ExternalValueSource fieldType that reads it's values from a file.  The file could be simple id,val records, and stored in the index directory so it would get replicated.  

Values could optionally be updated more often than the searcher (hashCode/equals should take this into account to prevent caching issues).
