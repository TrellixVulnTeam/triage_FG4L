This patch submits a schema browsing tool based on making Ajax calls to LukeRequestHandler.  It is in progress, but far enough along to generate discussion and see if people find it useful/perhaps incorporate some feedback.  It is similar to the XSLT-based schema browser in SOLR-75, in that it provides cross-referenced exploring of the major schema components (fields/field types/dynamic fields).  Since LukeRequestHandler provides more information, this version can provide more information than could the XSLT version, including statsitics and more information about dynamic fields.  Also, since it hits LukeRequestHandler, it probably also has much different performance that just transforming schema.xml.
