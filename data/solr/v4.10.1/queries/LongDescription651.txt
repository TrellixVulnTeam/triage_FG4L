A SearchComponent that can return TF-IDF vector for any given document in the SOLR index
Query : A Document Number / a query identifying a Document
Response :  A Map of term vs.TF-IDF value of every term in the Selected
Document
Why ?

Most of the Machine Learning Algorithms work on TFIDF representation of
documents, hence adding a Request Handler proving the TFIDF representation
will pave the way for incorporating Learning Paradigms to SOLR framework.
