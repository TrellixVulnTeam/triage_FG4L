'dataimporter' is a very commonly used namespace and it is quite long. for instance $
{dataimporter.last_index_time}
 takes up quite some space. can we alias it with  a single char '@' or '#' or a short name 'dih' so it can look like 


	$
{#.last_index_time}
or
	$
{@.last_index_time}
or
	$
{dih.last_index_time}
