Lines 102-133 in o.a.solr.schema.FieldProperties contain a large commented out block of code. It's generally a good thing to not commit this type of code â€“ if it's needed it can be looked up by the CM system for a prior revision. Trivial patch attached that removes the code block.

(note I found this while trying to understand the FieldType hierarchy with the goal of working on SOLR-1586 to help out...)
