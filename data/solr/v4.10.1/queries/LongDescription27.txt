With this patch, the language used by SnowballPorterFilterFactory is configurable, for example:

  <filter class="solr.SnowballPorterFilterFactory" language="French"/>

Invalid languages will cause a ClassNotFoundException when the filter is created (so at search time possibly, not at initialization time).
