didn't get any reply to this in email, filing as bug to make sure it's dealt with before 1.3 release (either by fixing documentation, or by fixing bug – still not sure what the problem is)

Subject: QueryElevationComponent and forceElevation=true ?


I don't know much about QueryElevationComponent but perusing the wiki docs and trying
it out with teh example configs i noticed that this URL didn't produce the output i
expected...

http://localhost:8983/solr/elevate?q=ipod&fl=id,price&sort=price+asc&forceElevation=true&enableElevation=true&debugQuery=true

..as far as i can tell, the forceElevation=true should cause "MA147LL/A" to always
apear at the top, regardless of the sort – but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Am I reading the docs wrong, or is this a bug?
