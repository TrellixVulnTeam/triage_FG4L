A RawResponseWriter writes a ContentStream directly to the response.

This is useful to spit back a file directly from solr.  This implementation looks for a response property named "content" and sends it to the client.  If it can't find one, it delegates the response to another ResponseWriter.

As an example, I added a GetAdminFileRequestHandler to replace /admin/get-file.jsp
